    <h2>
      <i>Presenting in Outline the Comfortable and Well-Regulated Paradox over
      which She Presides, and showing its Mental Elevation</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> suppose about the
      name there is no doubt. For sixty years we have followed that gifted
      gadabout and gossip, Heine, and called it Philistia. And yet, when one
      thinks of it, there may have been a mistake after all. Artemus Ward used
      to say that he had been able, with effort, to comprehend how it was
      possible to measure the distance between the stars, and even the
      dimensions and candle-power, so to speak, of those heavenly bodies; what
      beat him was how astronomers had ever found out their names. So I find
      myself wondering whether Philistia really is the right name for the land
      where She must be obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If so, it is only a little more the region of mysterious paradox and
      tricksy metamorphosis. We think of it always and from all time as given
      over to Her rule. We feel in our bones that there was a troglodyte Mrs
      Grundy; we imagine to ourselves a British matron contemporary with the
      cave bear and the woolly elephant But her very antiquity only makes it
      more puzzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an old gentleman who always tries to prove to me that the French
      are really Germans, that the Germans are all Slavs, and that the Russians
      are strictly Tartars: that is to say, that in keeping-count of the early
      races as they swarmed Westward we somehow skipped one, and have been wrong
      ever since. There must be some such explanation of how the domain which
      She sways came to be called Philistia.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say this, because the old Philistia was tremendously masculine. It was
      the Jews who struck the feminine note. They used to swagger no end when
      they won a victory, and utilise it to the utmost limit of merciless
      savagery; but when it came their turn to be thrashed they filled the very
      heavens with complaining clamour. We got no hint that the Philistines ever
      failed to take their medicine like men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider those splendid later Philistines, the Norsemen. In all their
      martial literature there is no suggestion of a whine. They loved fighting
      for its own sake; next to braining their foes, they admired being
      themselves hewn into sections. They never blamed their gods when they had
      the worst of it. They never insisted that they were always right and their
      enemies invariably wrong. They cared nothing about all that. They demanded
      only fun. It was their victims, the Frankish and Irish monks, who shed
      women&rsquo;s tears and besought Providence to play favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here is the paradox. The children of these Berserker loins are become
      the minions of Mrs Grundy. By some magic she has enshrined Respectability
      in their temples. In one division of her empire she makes Mr Helmer drink
      tea; in another she sets everybody reading the <i>Buchholz Family</i>; in
      her chosen island home her husband on the sunniest Sundays carries an
      umbrella instead of a walking-stick. Fancy the wild delirium of delight
      with which the old Philistines would have raided her homestead, chopping
      down her Robert Elsmeres, impaling her Horsleys, and making the skies
      lurid with the flames of her semi-detached villa! Yet we call her place
      Philistia!
    </p>
    <p>
      I know the villa very well. It is quite near to the South Kensington
      Museum. The title &ldquo;Fernbank&rdquo; is painted on the gate-posts. How
      well-ordered and comfortable does life beyond those posts remain! Here are
      no headaches in the morning. Here white-capped domestics move with neat
      alertness along the avenues of gentle routine, looking neither to the
      policeman on the right nor fiery-jacketed Thomas Atkins on the left. Here
      my friend Mr Albert Grundy invariably comes home by the Underground to
      dinner. Here his three daughters&mdash;girls of a type with a diminishing
      upper lip, with sharper chins and greater length of limb than of old&mdash;lead
      deeply washed existences, playing at tennis, smiling in flushed silence at
      visitors, feeding contentedly upon Mudie&rsquo;s stores, the while their mamma
      spreads the matrimonial net about the piano or makes tours of inspection
      among her outlying mantraps on the lawn. Here simpers the innocuous
      curate; here Uncle Dudley, who has seen life in Australia and the Far
      West, watches the bulbs and prunes the roses, and, I should think, yawns
      often to himself; here Lady Willoughby Wallaby&rsquo;s card diffuses refinement
      from the summit of the card-basket in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this happy home there came but last week&mdash;or was it the week
      before&mdash;a parcel of books. There were four complete novels in twelve
      volumes&mdash;fruits of that thoughtful arrangement by which the fair
      reader in Philistia is given three distinct opportunities to decide
      whether she will read the story through or not. Mrs Albert is a busy
      woman, burdened with manifold responsibilities to Church and State, to
      organised charities, to popularised music, to art-work guilds and the
      Amalgamated Association of Clear Starchers, not to mention a weather-eye
      kept at all times upon all unmarried males: but she still finds time to
      open all these packets of new books herself. On this occasion she gave to
      her eldest, Ermyntrude, the first volume of a novel by Mrs &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      It doesn&rsquo;t matter what fell to the share of the younger Amy and Floribel.
      For herself she reserved the three volumes of the latest work of Mr
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tells me now that words simply can <i>not</i> express her thankfulness
      for having done so. It seems the selection was not entirely accidental.
      She was attracted, she admits, by the charmingly dainty binding of the
      volumes, but she was also moved by an instinct, half maternal prescience,
      half literary recollection. She thought she remembered having seen the
      name of this man-writer before. Where? It came to her like a flash, she
      says. Only a while ago he had a hook called <i>A Bunch of Patrician Ladies</i>
      or something of that sort, which she almost made up her mind not to let
      the girls read at all, but at last, with some misgivings, permitted them
      to skim hastily, because though the morals were rocky&mdash;perhaps that
      wasn&rsquo;t her word&mdash;the society was very good. But this new book of his
      had not even that saving feature. Respectable people were only
      incidentally mentioned in it. Really it was quite <i>too</i> low. The
      chief figure was a farm-girl who for the most part skimmed milk or cut
      swedes in a field, and at other times behaved in a manner positively
      unmentionable. Mrs Albert told me she had locked the volumes up, after
      only partially perusing them. I might be sure <i>her</i> daughters never
      laid eyes on them. They had gone back to the library, with a note
      expressing surprise that such immoral books should be sent into any
      Christian family. What made the matter worse, she went on, was that
      Ermyntrude read in some paper, at a friend&rsquo;s house, that this man, whoever
      he may be, was the greatest of English novelists, and that this particular
      book of his was a tragic work of the noblest and loftiest order, which
      dignified the language. She was sure she didn&rsquo;t know what England was
      coming to, when reporters were allowed to put things like that in the
      papers. Fortunately she only took in <i>The Daily Tarradiddle</i>, which
      one could always rely upon for sound views, and which gave this
      unspeakable book precisely the contemptuous little notice it deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief, however&mdash;and here the good matron visibly brightened
      up&mdash;to think that really wholesome and improving novels were still
      produced. There was that novel by Mrs &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Had I
      read it? Oh,
    </p>
    <p>
      I must lose no time! Perhaps it was not altogether so enchanting as that
      first immortal work of hers, which had almost, one might say, founded a
      new religion. True, one of the girls in it worked altar-cloths for a
      church, and occasionally the other characters broke out into religious
      conversation; but there were no clergymen to speak of, and the charm of
      the other&rsquo;s ecclesiastical mysticism was lacking. &ldquo;To be frank, the first
      and last volumes were just a bit slow. But oh! the lovely second volume! A
      young Englishman and his sister go to Paris. They stumble right at the
      start into the most delightful, picturesque, artistic set. Think of it:
      Henri Régnault is personally introduced, and delivers himself of extended
      remarks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met an old friend of Regnault&rsquo;s at the Club the other day,&rdquo; I
      interposed, &ldquo;who complained bitterly of that. He said it was insufferable
      impudence to bring him in at all, and still worse to make him talk such
      blather as is put into his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert sniffed at this Club friend and went on. That Paris part of the
      book seemed to her to just palpitate with life. It was Paris to the very
      letter&mdash;gay, intellectual, sparkling, and oh! so free! The young
      Englishman at once set up a romantic establishment in the heart of
      Fontainebleau Forest with a French painter-girl. His sister was almost as
      promptly debauched by an elderly French sculptor. But you never lost sight
      of the fact that the author was teaching a valuable moral lesson by all
      this. Indeed, that whole part of the book was called &ldquo;Storm and Stress.&rdquo;
       And all the while you saw, too, how innately superior the national
      character of the young Englishman was to that of the French people about
      him. One <i>knew</i> that in good time <i>he</i> would have a moral
      awakening, and return to England, marry, settle down, and make money in
      his business. Side by side with this you saw the entire hopelessness of
      any spiritual regeneration in the French painter-girl or any of her
      artistic set. And this was shown with such delicate art&mdash;it was so <i>perfect</i>
      a picture of the moral contrast between the two nations&mdash;that the
      girls saw it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the girls,&rdquo; I put in&mdash;&ldquo;that is to say, you didn&rsquo;t lock <i>this</i>
      book up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert lifted her eyebrows at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Do you know who the author is? The idea!
      Why, the papers print whole columns about <i>anything</i> she writes.
      Every day you may see paragraphs about the mere prospect of books she
      hasn&rsquo;t even begun yet. I suppose such blatant publicity must be very
      distressing to her, but the public simply insist upon it. <i>The Daily
      Tarradiddle</i> devoted an entire leader to this particular book. I assure
      you, all my friends are talking of nothing else&mdash;many of them people,
      too, whom you would not suspect of any literary tastes whatever, and who
      <i>never</i> read novels as a rule. But they don&rsquo;t regard <i>this</i> as a
      novel. They think of it&mdash;I quote Lady Willoughby Wallaby&rsquo;s exact
      words&mdash;as an exposition of those Christian principles which make our
      England what it is.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      <i>Setting forth the Untoward Circumstances under which the Right Tale was
      Unfolded in the Wrong Company</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>uch has been
      written about that variety of &ldquo;cab-wit&rdquo; which occurs to a man on his way
      home from dinner: the brilliant sallies he might have made, the smart
      retorts which would so bravely have reversed the balance of laughter had
      they only come in time. We are less frank about the other sort. No one
      dwells in type upon the manner in which we marshal our old jokes and
      arrange our epigrams as we drive along to the house of feasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the practice of getting up table-talk is going out. The
      three-bottle men took it to the grave with them, along with the snuff-box,
      and the toupee, and the feather-bed, and other amenities of the Regency.
      There never was but one diner-out in the London of my knowledge who was at
      pains to prepare his conversations, each for its special occasion and
      audience, and he, poor man, broke down under the strain and disappeared
      from view. The others are too lazy, too indifferent, too cocksure of
      themselves, to go to all this bother. The old courtly sense of
      responsibility to the host is perished from among them. But none the less,
      the least dutiful and diligent of all their number does ask himself
      questions as the whirling rubber tyres bear him onward, and the cab-mirror
      shows him the face of a man to whom people ought to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question I asked myself, as I drove past the flaring shop windows of
      Old Brompton Road the other evening, was whether the Grundys would
      probably like my story of Nate Salsbury and the Citizen of South Bend,
      Indiana. A good deal depended upon the decision. It was a story which had
      greatly solidified my position in other hospitable quarters; it could be
      brought in <i>apropos</i> of almost anything, or for that matter of quite
      nothing at all; it had never been printed, so far as I know, in any of
      those American comic papers which supply alike the dining-rooms of Mayfair
      and the editorial offices of Fleet Street with such humour as they come
      into possession of; and I enjoyed telling it. On the other hand, the
      Grundys were old friends of mine, who would never suspect that they had
      missed anything if I preserved silence on the subject of South Bend, and
      who would go on asking me to dinner whether I told new tales or not;
      moreover, their attitude towards fresh jokes was always a precarious
      quantity, and I had an uneasy feeling that if I told my story to them and
      it failed to come off, so to speak, I should never have the same
      confidence in it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had entered the drawing-room of Fernbank, shaken hands with Mrs
      Albert Grundy and Ermyntrude, and stolen a little glance about the circle
      as I walked over to the fireplace, it had become clear that the story was
      not to be told. Beside the half-dozen of the family, including the curate,
      there was a tall young man with a very high collar, shoulders that sloped
      down like a Rhine-wine bottle, and a stern expression of countenance.
      Uncle Dudley whispered to me, as we held our hands over the asbestos, that
      he was a literary party, and the son of old Sir Watkyn Hump, who was a
      director in one of Albert&rsquo;s companies. The other guests were a stout and
      motherly lady in a cap and a purplish smile, and a darkling young woman
      with a black velvet riband around her thin neck, and a look of wearied
      indifference upon her face. This effect of utter boredom did not visibly
      diminish upon my being presented to Miss Wallaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an extremely well-turned little brace of sentences with which to
      convey the intelligence to a young lady that the honour of taking her down
      to dinner has fallen upon me&mdash;sentences which combine professions of
      admiring pleasure with just a grateful dash of respectful playfulness;
      they brought no new light into Miss Wallaby&rsquo;s somewhat scornful <i>pince-nez</i>.
      Decidedly I would not tell my South Bend story <i>that</i> night!
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the same I did. What led up to it I hardly know. It was at the
      ptarmigan stage, I remember&mdash;or was it a capercailzie?&mdash;and
      young Mr Hump had commented upon the great joy of living in England, where
      one could enjoy delicious game all the year round, instead of in a country
      like America, where the inhabitants notoriously had nothing but fried salt
      pork to eat for many months at a time. Perhaps it was not worth while, but
      I ventured the correcting remark that there was no season of the year when
      one couldn&rsquo;t have eighteen edible varieties of wild birds in America for
      every one that England has ever heard of. Mr Hump preened his chin about
      on the summit of his collar and smiled with superior incredulity. The
      others looked grave. Mrs Grundy whispered to me warningly, over her left
      shoulder, that Mr Hump had made America his special subject, and wrote
      most vigorous and comminatory articles about it almost every week. I was
      painfully conscious that Miss Wallaby&rsquo;s cold right shoulder had been still
      further withdrawn from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was at this grotesquely inauspicious moment that I told my story.
      It is easy enough now to see that it was sheer folly, madness if you like,
      to do so. I was only too bitterly conscious of that when I reviewed the
      events of the evening in my homeward cab. It was <i>apropos</i> of nothing
      under the wide sky. But at the moment, I suppose, I hoped that it would
      relieve the situation. In one sense it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baldly summarised, this is the tale. Years ago the admirable Nate Salsbury
      was on a &ldquo;one-night-stand&rdquo; tour with his bright little company of
      comedians through the least urban districts of Indiana, and came upon
      South Bend, which is an important centre of the wagon-making industry, but
      is not precisely a focussing point of dramatic traditions and culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vestibule of the small theatre that evening there paced up and down
      a tall, middle-aged, weasel-backed citizen, his hands plunged deep in his
      pockets, doubt and irresolution written all over his face. As others paid
      their money and passed in he would watch them with obvious longing; then
      he would go and study once more the attractive coloured bill of the
      Company, with its bevy of pretty girls in skirts just short enough to
      disclose most enticing little ankles; then once more he would resume his
      perplexed walk to and fro. At last he made up his mind, and approached
      Salsbury with diffidence. &ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;air you the boss of this
      show?&rdquo; &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; asked Nate. &ldquo;Well&mdash;no offence meant&mdash;but&mdash;can
      I&mdash;that is to say&mdash;will it be all right to bring a lady to your
      show?&rdquo; &ldquo;That, sir, depends!&rdquo; responded the manager firmly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the
      citizen went on, &ldquo;what I was gittin&rsquo; at is this&mdash;can I be perfectly
      safe in bringin&rsquo; <i>my wife</i> here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Salsbury with dignity, and an eye trained to abstain from
      twinkling, &ldquo;it is no portion of my business to inquire whether she is your
      wife or not, but if she comes in here she&rsquo;s got to behave herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A solitary note of laughter fell upon the air when I had told this story,
      and on the instant Uncle Dudley, perceiving that he had made a mistake,
      dropped his napkin, and came up from fishing for it on the floor red-faced
      and dumb. All else was deadly silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose they really weren&rsquo;t married at all?&rdquo; said the curate,
      after a chilling pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage, I regret to say, means next to nothing in most parts of
      America,&rdquo; remarked Mr Hump, judicially. &ldquo;The most sacred ties are there
      habitually made the subject of ribald jests. I have been assured by a
      person who spent nearly three weeks in the United States some years since
      that it is an extremely rare experience to meet an adult American who has
      not been divorced at least once. This fact made a vivid impression on my
      mind at the time, and I&mdash;ahem!&mdash;have written frequently upon it
      since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the trouble arises from their all living in hotels&mdash;having
      no home life whatever,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert, with a kindly air of coming to my
      rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth told you that?&rdquo; I began, but was cut short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; broke in Miss Wallaby, with frosty distinctness of tone and
      enunciation, &ldquo;that the assumption upon which the incident just related is
      based&mdash;the assumption that the la&mdash;woman referred to would
      probably misconduct herself in a place of public resort&mdash;seems to me
      startlingly characteristic of the country of which it is narrated. It has
      been truly said that the most valuable test of a country&rsquo;s actual, as
      distinct from its assumed, worth, is the respect it pays to its women.
      Both at Cheltenham and at Newnham the idea is steadily inculcated&mdash;I
      might say insisted upon as of paramount importance&mdash;that the nation&rsquo;s
      real civilisation rests upon the measure, not alone of chivalrous
      deference, but of esteem and confidence which my sex, by its devotion to
      duty, and its intellectual sympathy with broad aims and lofty purposes, is
      able to inspire and command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I assure you,&rdquo; I protested feebly, &ldquo;the story I told was a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some subjects,&rdquo; interposed Lady Willoughby Wallaby, the fixed
      smile lighting up with an angry, winter-sunset glow her inflamed
      countenance&mdash;&ldquo;there are some subjects on which it is best not to
      joke.&rdquo; As she spoke she wagged a mitted thumb at her hostess, and on the
      instant the ladies rose. Mr Hump hastened round to hold the door open as
      they filed out, their heads high in air, their skirts rustling indignantly
      over the threshold. Then he followed them, closing the door with decision
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad, Albert,&rdquo; said Uncle Dudley, reaching over for the port, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      wonder that the pick of our young fellows go in for marrying American
      girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass it along!&rdquo; remarked the father of Mrs Albert&rsquo;s three daughters, in a
      voice of confirmed dejection.

      to look in the daylight. Yes&mdash;there&rsquo;s our four-wheeler. (<i>Exeunt
      omnes.</i>)
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he above is not
      intended for presentation upon any stage&mdash;not even that of the
      Independent Theatre. It has been cast into the dramatic mould merely for
      convenience&rsquo; sake. It embodies what I chiefly remember about Picture
      Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has come to be my annual duty&mdash;a peculiarly hardy, not to say
      temerarious, annual&mdash;to convoy Mrs Albert Grundy and her party about
      sections of Chelsea and Brompton on the earlier of the two Show Sabbaths.
      I drifted into this function through having once shared an attic with a
      young painter, whose colleagues used to come to borrow florins of him
      whenever one of his pictures disappeared from any shop window, and so
      incidentally formed my acquaintance. My claim nowadays upon their
      recollection is really very slight. I just know them well enough to manage
      the last Sunday in March: even that might be awkward if they were not such
      good-natured fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it would be difficult to persuade Mrs Albert of this. That good lady
      is wont, when the playfully benignant mood is upon her, to describe me as
      her connecting link with Bohemia. She probably would be puzzled to explain
      her meaning; I certainly should. But if she were provided with affidavits
      setting forth the whole truth&mdash;viz., that my entire income is derived
      from an inherited part-interest in an artificial-ice machine; that there
      are two clergymen on the committee of my only club; that I am free from
      debt; and that I play duets on the piano with my sister&mdash;still would
      she cling to the belief that I am a young man with an extremely gay,
      rakish side, who could make thrilling revelations of Bohemia if I would.
      Of course, I am never questioned on the subject; but I can see that it is
      a point upon which the faith of Fernbank is firmly grounded. Often Mrs
      Albert&rsquo;s conversation cuts figure-eights on very thin ice when we are
      alone, as if just to show me that <i>she</i> knows. More than once I have
      discovered Ermyntrude looking furtively at me, as the wistful shepherd-boy
      on the plains of Dura might have gazed at the distant haze overhanging
      bold, unspeakable Babylon. I rarely visit the house but Uncle Dudley winks
      at me. However, nothing is ever asked me about the dreadful things with
      which they suppose me to be upon intimate terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed for a long time, on Sunday, as if an easy escape had been
      arranged for me by Providence. At two o&rsquo;clock, the hour appointed for our
      crusade, a heavy fog overhung everything. Looking out from the
      drawing-room windows, only the very nearest of the neatly trimmed firs on
      the lawn were to be distinguished. The street beyond was utter blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock the ladies took off their bonnets. It was really too bad.
      Uncle Dudley, strolling in from his nap in the library, suggested that
      with a lantern we might visit some of the nearer studios: &ldquo;not necessarily
      for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith.&rdquo; Mrs Albert turned a
      look of tearful vexation upon him, before which he fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this consolation,&rdquo; she remarked presently, holding me with an
      unwavering eye: &ldquo;if we are to be defrauded out of our expedition to-day,
      that will furnish all the more reason why you should take us next Sunday&mdash;<i>the</i>
      Sunday. You have often talked of having us see the Academicians at home&mdash;but
      we&rsquo;ve never been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember that there has been talk about it,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but hardly that
      the talk was mine. Truth is, I don&rsquo;t know a single Academician, even by
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that they did not believe me. Mrs Albert continued: &ldquo;Lady
      Wallaby expressed surprise, only last evening, that we should consent to
      go about among the outsiders. She and her daughter <i>never</i> do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outsiders!&rdquo; I was tempted into saying. &ldquo;Why, they can paint the head off
      the Academy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Timby-Hucks simpered outright. &ldquo;You do say such droll things!&rdquo; she
      remarked, somewhat obscurely. &ldquo;Mamma always declares that you remind her
      of the <i>Sydney Bulletin</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom <i>do</i> you take to the Academy Show Sunday?&mdash;or perhaps I
      oughtn&rsquo;t to ask,&rdquo; came from Ermyntrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we have no right to inquire,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert; and I turned to the
      window and the enshrouded lawn once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the fog lifted. The bonnets were produced again. Nearly three
      hours of daylight remained to us. Tidings that the horse was too lame to
      be taken out only staggered Mrs Albert for the briefest fraction of time.
      There were still four-wheelers in Gilead. Besides, if the driver happened
      to be sober, he would know the streets so much better than their stupid
      coachman. This would be of advantage, because time was so limited. We
      should have to just run in, say &ldquo;How-d&rsquo;ye-do,&rdquo; take a flying look round,
      and scamper out again, Mrs Albert said. By firmly adhering to this rule,
      she estimated that we might do sixteen or seventeen studios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven alone knows how many we did &ldquo;do.&rdquo; Nor have I any clear
      recollections of what we saw. A confused vision remains to me of long
      hall-ways lined with frames and packing-cases; half-an-acre, more or less,
      of painted canvas, out of which only here and there a pair of bright eyes,
      a glowing field of poppies, or the sheen from a satin gown, fixed itself
      disconnectedly on the memory; hordes and hordes of tall young women
      helping themselves to tea and cakes; and always the pathetic figure of the
      artist&rsquo;s wife, or sister, tired to very death, standing by the door with a
      wearied smile on her lips, and the polite falsehood, &ldquo;So good of you to
      come!&rdquo; on her tongue. I wondered, I remember, if she never forgot herself
      and said instead, &ldquo;So kind of you to go!&rdquo; But under Mrs Albert&rsquo;s system
      there was no time to wait and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, indeed, we dallied over our task. Mrs Albert encountered a lady from
      Wormwood Scrubs of her acquaintance, who was indiscreet enough to mention
      that she had been asked to stop here for supper. The news spread through
      the petticoated portion of my group as by magic. Miss Timby-Hucks came
      over and asked me, so audibly that the artist-host had to blush and turn
      away, if I didn&rsquo;t think it would be a deliciously romantic experience to
      sup in one of these lofty studios, with the gaslight on the armour, and
      the great, solemnly silent pictures looking down upon us as we ate. Mrs
      Albert lingered for some time looking at this artist&rsquo;s work with her head
      on one side, and eyes filled with rapt, dreamy enjoyment&mdash;but nothing
      came of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after we had been back in Fern-bank for an hour or more&mdash;our
      own cold repast nearly over&mdash;that Mrs Albert thought of something.
      She laid down her fork with a gesture of annoyance. &ldquo;It has just occurred
      to me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we never went to that Mr Whistler&rsquo;s, whose pictures are
      on exhibition in Bond Street. Everybody&rsquo;s talking about him, and I did so
      want not to miss his studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he has a Show Sunday,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I never heard of it, if he
      has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, it is only these last few weeks that anybody has heard of him,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert replied. &ldquo;I read the first announcement about his beautiful
      pictures in <i>The Daily Tarradiddle</i> only the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whistler? Whistler?&rdquo; put in Uncle Dudley. &ldquo;Why, surely <i>he&rsquo;s</i> not
      new. Why&mdash;I remember&mdash;he was mixed up in a law-suit, wasn&rsquo;t it,
      years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, Dudley,&rdquo; responded Mrs Albert; &ldquo;I was under that same impression,
      till Lady Wallaby set me right. It seems that was another man altogether&mdash;some
      foreign adventurer who pretended to be able to paint and imposed upon
      people&mdash;don&rsquo;t you recall how <i>The Tarradiddle</i> exposed him?&mdash;and
      Mr Burnt-Jones had him arrested, or something&mdash;O, quite a dreadful
      person. But <i>this</i> Mr Whistler is an Englishman. I read in <i>The
      Illustrated London News</i> that he represented modern British Art. That
      alone would make it quite clear it was a different man. I did so want to
      see him! Lady-Wallaby tells me she has heard he is extremely amusing in
      his conversation&mdash;and quite presentable manners, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask him to dinner?&rdquo; said Mr Albert Grundy. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s amusing
      it&rsquo;s more than most of the men you drum up are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to think <i>everybody</i> can be asked to dinner, Albert,&rdquo; the
      lady of the house replied. &ldquo;Artists don&rsquo;t dine&mdash;unless they are in
      the Academy, of course. Tea, yes&mdash;or perhaps supper; but one doesn&rsquo;t
      ask people to meet them at dinner. It&rsquo;s like actors&mdash;and&mdash;and
      non-commissioned officers.&rdquo;

       said Uncle Dudley, stretching out his slippered feet, and thrusting his
      thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat&mdash;&ldquo;it is my opinion that
      women are different from men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several commentators have advanced this view,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;For example,
      it has been noted that the gentle sex cross a muddy street on their heels,
      whereas we skip over on our toes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is interesting if true,&rdquo; responded Uncle Dudley. &ldquo;What I mean is
      that all this talk about the human race is humbug. There are <i>two</i>
      human races! And they are getting wider apart every few minutes, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you mentioned this to any one?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley went on developing his theme. &ldquo;I daresay that for millions of
      years after the re-separation of the sexes this difference was too slight
      to be noticed at all. The cave man, for instance&mdash;the fellow who went
      around hunting the Ichthyosaurus with a brick tied on the end of an elm
      club, and spent the whole winter underground sucking the old bones, and
      then whittling them up into Runic buttons for the South Kensington Museum:
      I suppose, now, that his wife and sister-in-law, say, didn&rsquo;t strike him as
      being specially different from himself&mdash;except, of course, in that
      they only got plain bones and gristle and so on to eat, whereas all the
      marrow and general smooth-sailing in meats went his way. <i>You</i>, can&rsquo;t
      imagine <i>him</i> saying to himself: &lsquo;These female people here are not of
      my race at all They are of another species. They are in reality as much my
      natural enemies as that long-toed, red-headed, brachycephalous tramp
      living in the gum-tree down by the swamp, who makes offensive gestures as
      I ride past on my tame <i>Ursus spelous</i>&rsquo;&mdash;now, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I frankly shook my head. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to imagine that. It
      would be almost as hard as to guess off-hand where, when, and how you
      caught this remarkable scientific spasm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley smiled. He rose, and walked with leisurely lightness up and
      down in front of the chimney-piece, still with his palms spread like
      little misplaced wings before his armpits. He smiled again. Then he
      stopped on the hearth-rug and looked down amiably upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye think? There&rsquo;s something in it, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;what puzzles me is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t mean to say that I&rsquo;ve worked it all out,&rdquo; put in Uncle Dudley,
      reassuringly. &ldquo;Why, I get puzzled myself, every once in a while. But I&rsquo;m
      on the right track, my boy; and, as they say in Adelaide, I&rsquo;m going to
      hang to it like a pup to a root.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been this way?&rdquo; I asked, with an affectation of
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley answered with shining eyes. &ldquo;Why, if you&rsquo;ll believe me, it
      seems now as if I&rsquo;d had the germs of the idea in my mind ever since I came
      back to England, and began living here at Fernbank. But the thing dawned
      upon me&mdash;that is to say, took shape in my head&mdash;less than a
      fortnight ago. It all came about through being up here one evening with
      nothing to read, and my toe worse than usual, and Mrs Albert having been
      out of sorts all through dinner. Somehow, I felt all at once that I&rsquo;d got
      to read scientific works. I couldn&rsquo;t resist it. I was like Joan of Arc
      when the cows and sheep took partners for a quadrille. I heard voices&mdash;Darwin&rsquo;s
      and&mdash;and&mdash;Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s&mdash;and&mdash;lots of others. I
      hobbled downstairs to the library, and I brought up a whole armful of the
      books that Mrs Albert bought when she expected Lady Wallaby was going to
      be able to get her an invitation to attend the Hon. Mrs Coon-Alwyn&rsquo;s
      Biological Conversaziones. Look there! What do you say to that for ten
      days&rsquo; work? And had to cut every leaf, into the bargain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gazed with respect at the considerable row of books he indicated: books
      for the most part bound in the scarlet of the International Series or the
      maroon of Contemporary Science, but containing also brown covers, and even
      green &ldquo;sport&rdquo; varieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what is it all about?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Why have you read these
      things? Why not the reports of the Commission on Agricultural Depression,
      or Lewis Morris&rsquo;s poems, or even&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but my imagination
      faltered and broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was instinct, my boy,&rdquo; returned Uncle Dudley, with impressive
      confidence. &ldquo;There had been a thought&mdash;a great idea&mdash;growing and
      swelling in my head ever since I had been living in this house. But I
      couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was. As you might say, it was wrapped up in a
      cocoon, like the larvæ of the lepidoptera&mdash;ahem!&mdash;and something
      was needed to bring it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was here last you were trying Hollands with quinine bitters,&rdquo; I
      remarked casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool!&rdquo; Uncle Dudley admonished me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead in earnest. As I said,
      it was pure instinct that led me to these books. They have made everything
      clear. I only wanted their help to get the husk off my discovery, and
      hoist it on my back, us it were, and bring it out here in the daylight.
      And so now you know what I&rsquo;m getting at when I say: Women are different
      from Men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the discovery, then?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley nodded several times. Then he went on, with emphasised
      slowness: &ldquo;I have lived here now for four years, seeing my sister-in-law
      every day, watching Ermyntrude grow up to womanhood and the little girls
      peg along behind her, and meeting the female friends who come here to see
      them&mdash;and, sir, I tell you, they&rsquo;re not alone a different sex:
      they&rsquo;re a different animal altogether! Take my word for it, they&rsquo;re a
      species by themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Timby-Hucks is certainly very much by herself,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend smiled. &ldquo;And not altogether her own fault either,&rdquo; he commented.
      &ldquo;But, speaking of science, it&rsquo;s remarkable how, when you once get a firm
      grip on a big, central, main-guy fact, all the little facts come in of
      their own accord to support it. Now, there&rsquo;s that young simpleton you met
      here at dinner a while ago: I mean Eustace Hump. Do you know that both
      Ermyntrude and the Timby-Hucks, and even Miss Wallaby, think that that
      chap is a perfect ideal of masculine wit and beauty? You and I would
      hesitate about using him to wad a horse-pistol with: but there isn&rsquo;t one
      of those girls that wouldn&rsquo;t leap with joy if he began proposing to her;
      and as for their mothers, why, the old ladies watch him as a kingfisher
      eyes a tadpole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your similes are exciting,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but what do they go to show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, science can show anything. I haven&rsquo;t gone all through it
      yet, but I tell you, it&rsquo;s wonderful! Take this, for instance&rdquo;&mdash;he
      reached for a green book on the mantel, and turned over the leaves&mdash;&ldquo;now
      listen to this. The book is written by a man named Wallace&mdash;nice,
      shrewd-looking old party by his picture, you can see&mdash;and this is
      what he says on page 285: &lsquo;Some peahens preferred an old pied peacock; a
      Canada goose paired with a Bernicle gander; a male widgeon was preferred
      by a pintail duck to its own species; a hen canary preferred a male
      greenfinch to either linnet, goldfinch, siskin, or chaffinch.&rsquo; Now, do you
      see that? The moment my eyes first lighted on that, I said to myself: &lsquo;Now
      I understand about the girls and Eustace Hump.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t it clear to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;You ought to read a paper at the Royal Aquarium&mdash;before
      the Balloon Society, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then look at this,&rdquo; Uncle Dudley went on, with animation. &ldquo;Now, you
      and I would ask ourselves what on earth such a gawky, spindling,
      poor-witted youngster as that thought he was doing among women, anyhow.
      But you turn over the page, and here you have it: &lsquo;Goat-suckers, geese,
      carrion vultures, and many other birds of plain plumage have been observed
      to dance, spread their wings or tails, and perform strange love-antics.&rsquo; 
      Doesn&rsquo;t that fasten Hump to the wall like a beetle on a pin, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not sure that I entirely follow its application to your original
      point,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About women, you mean? My boy, in science everything applies. The woods
      are full of applications. But seriously, women <i>are</i> different. As I
      said, in the barbarism at the back of beyond this divergence started. With
      the beginning of what we call civilisation, it became more and more
      marked. The progress of the separation increases nowadays by square-root&mdash;or
      whatever you call it. The sexes are wider apart to-day than ever. They
      like each other less; they quarrel more. You can see that in the Divorce
      Courts, in the diminished proportion of early marriages, in the increasing
      evidences of domestic infelicity all about one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not refrain from expressing the fear that all this boded ill for
      the perpetuity of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley is a light-hearted man. He was not depressed by the
      apprehensions to which I had given utterance. Instead he hummed pleasantly
      to himself as he put Wallace back on the shelf. He began chuckling as a
      moment later he bethought himself to fill our glasses afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I ever tell you my cat story?&rdquo; he asked cheerily, testing the knob to
      see that the door was shut. &ldquo;Once a little boy came in to his father and
      said: &lsquo;Pa, we won&rsquo;t be troubled any more with those cats howling about on
      our roof at night. I&rsquo;ve just been looking out of the upstairs window, and
      they&rsquo;re all out there fighting and screaming and tearing each other to
      pieces. There won&rsquo;t be one of them alive by morning!&rsquo; Then the father
      replied: &lsquo;My son, you imagine a vain thing. When increasing years shall
      have furnished your mind with a more copious store of knowledge, you will
      grasp the fact that all this commotion and dire disturbance which you
      report to me only signifies more cats.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture the servant came in with the soda-water. We talked no
      more of science that evening.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HAD strolled
      about the galleries of Burlington House for a couple of hours on Press
      Day, looking a little at pictures here and there, but for the most part
      contemplating with admiration the zeal and good faith of the ladies and
      gentlemen who stopped, note-book in hand, before every frame: when some
      one behind me gave a friendly tug at my sleeve. I turned, to find myself
      confronted by a person I seemed not to know&mdash;a small young woman in
      an alpine hat and a veil which masked everything about her face except its
      dentigerous smile. Even as I looked I was conscious of regret that, if
      acquaintances were to be made for me in this spontaneous fashion, destiny
      had not selected instead a certain tall, slender, dark young lady, clad
      all in black and cock&rsquo;s-plumes, whom I had been watching at her work of
      notetaking in room after room, with growing interest. Then, peering more
      closely through the veil, I discovered that I was being accosted by Miss
      Timby-Hucks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo; she said, with a vivacious half-giggle, as we shook
      hands; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re not specially pleased to see me; and you&rsquo;re asking
      yourself, &lsquo;What on earth is she doing here?&rsquo; Now, don&rsquo;t deny it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; I made awkward response&mdash;&ldquo;of course&mdash;<i>Press</i>
      day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I belong to the Press,&rdquo; said Miss Timby-Hucks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy Press! And since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O it&rsquo;s nearly a fortnight now. And most <i>interesting</i> I find the
      work. You know, for a long time now I&rsquo;ve been <i>so</i> restless, <i>so</i>
      anxious to find some opening to a real career, where I might be my genuine
      self, and be an active part of the great whirling stream of existence, and
      concentrate my mind upon the actualities of life&mdash;don&rsquo;t you yourself
      think it will be <i>just</i> the thing for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; I replied without hesitation. &ldquo;And do you find focussing
      yourself on the actualities&mdash;ah&mdash;remunerative?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Miss Timby-Hucks explained, &ldquo;nothing of mine has been printed yet,
      you see, so that I don&rsquo;t know as to that. But I am assured it will be all
      right. You see, I&rsquo;m <i>very</i> intimate with a cousin of Mrs Umpelbaum,
      who is the wife of the proprietor of <i>Maida Vale</i>, and in that way it
      came about. Lady-reporters never have any chance, I am told, unless they
      have friends in the proprietor&rsquo;s family, or know the editor extremely
      well. It all goes by favour, like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the dearest of all the actualities,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;But how is it they
      don&rsquo;t print your stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t written any, as yet. The difficulty was to find a subject,&rdquo;
       Miss Timby-Hucks rejoined. &ldquo;O that awful &lsquo;subject&rsquo;! I thought and thought
      and thought till my head was fit to burst. I went to see Mrs Umpelbaum
      herself, and asked her to suggest something. You know she writes a great
      deal for the paper herself. She said they hadn&rsquo;t had any &lsquo;Reminiscences of
      Carlyle&rsquo; now for some weeks; but afterwards she agreed with me that would
      not be quite the thing for one to <i>begin</i> with. She couldn&rsquo;t suggest
      anything else, except that I should have a chat with my dressmaker. Very
      often in that way, she said, lady-reporters get the most <i>entertaining</i>
      revelations of gossip in high life. But it happened that just then it was
      not&mdash;not exactly convenient&mdash;for me to call upon my dressmaker;
      and so <i>that</i> suggestion came to nothing, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea lady-journalism was so difficult,&rdquo; I remarked, with
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O indeed, yes!&rdquo; Miss Timby-Hucks went on. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t expect to be <i>en
      rapport</i>, as we journalists say, with Society, without spending a great
      deal of money. There is one lady-reporter, Mrs Umpelbaum told me, who has
      made quite a leading position for herself, solely through hairdressers and
      American dentists. But I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that that would involve more
      of an outlay than I could afford, just at the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you never got a subject?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; finally I did. I was over at the Grundys&rsquo;, telling my troubles, and
      Uncle Dudley&mdash;you know, being so much with the girls, I always call
      him that&mdash;Uncle Dudley said that the fashionable thing now was
      interviews, and that lady-journalists did this better than
      gentlemen-reporters because they had more nerve. By that I suppose he
      meant a more delicate nervous organisation, quicker to grasp and absorb
      fine shades of character. But that hardly helped me, because whom was I to
      interview, and about what? <i>That</i> was the question! But Uncle Dudley
      thought a moment, and was ready with a suggestion. Everything depended, he
      said, upon making a right start. I must pick out a personality and a theme
      at once non-contentious and invested with popular interest His idea was
      that I should begin by interviewing Mr T. M. Healy on &lsquo;The Decline of the
      Deep-Sea Mock-Turtle Fisheries on the West Coast of Ireland.&rsquo; If I could
      get Mr Healy to talk frankly on this subject, he felt sure that I should
      chain public attention at a bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superb!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;And did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miss Timby-Hucks confessed; &ldquo;I went to the House and sent in my
      card, but it was another Irish Member who came out to see me&mdash;I think
      his name was Mulhooly. He was very polite, and explained that since some
      recent sad event in one of the Committee Rooms, fifteen I think its number
      was, it was the rule of his party that, when a lady sent in a card to one
      Member, some other Member answered it. It prevented confusion, he said,
      and was not in antagonism to the expressed views of the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of nothing,&rdquo; I said, leading the way over to a divan, on which we
      seated ourselves: &ldquo;you seem to have finally secured a subject. I assume
      you are doing the Academy for <i>Maida Vale</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Miss Timby-Hucks with gentle firmness; &ldquo;you might say I
      have <i>done</i> it. I have been here since the very minute the doors
      opened, and I&rsquo;ve gone twelve times round. I wish I could have seen you
      earlier. I should so like to have had your opinion of the various works as
      we passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better not,&rdquo; I commented. &ldquo;There are ladies present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady-reporter looked at me for a furtive instant dubiously. Then she
      smiled a little under her veil. &ldquo;You <i>do</i> say such odd things!&rdquo; she
      remarked. &ldquo;I am glad to see that a great many ladies <i>are</i> present.
      It shows how we are securing our proper recognition in journalism. I
      believe there are actually more of us here than there are
      gentlemen-reporters&mdash;I should say gentle-men-critics. And it is the
      same in art, too. You can see&mdash;I&rsquo;ve counted them up in my catalogue
      here&mdash;there are this year two hundred and forty-four lady-artists
      exhibiting in this Academy three hundred and forty-six works of art. Think
      of that! Fifty of them are described as Mrs, and there are one hundred and
      ninety-four who are unmarried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of <i>that!</i>&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are among them,&rdquo; Miss Timby-Hucks went on, &ldquo;one Marchioness,
      one Countess, one Baroness, and one plain Lady. I am going to begin my
      article with this. I think it will be interesting, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be careful not to particularise about the plain Lady,&rdquo; I suggested.
      &ldquo;That might be <i>too</i> interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was over-full of her subject to smile. &ldquo;No, I mean,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as
      showing how the ranks of British Art are being filled from the very
      highest classes, and are appealing more and more to the female intellect.
      I don&rsquo;t believe it will occur to any one else to count up in the
      catalogue. So that will be original with me&mdash;to enlighten my sex as
      to the glorious part they play in this year&rsquo;s Academy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you seen their pictures?&rdquo; I asked, repressing an involuntary
      groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one!&rdquo; replied Miss Timby-Hucks. &ldquo;They are all good. There isn&rsquo;t
      what I should call a bad one&mdash;that is, a Frenchy or immoral one&mdash;among
      them. I shall say that, too, in my criticism; but of course I shall have
      to word it carefully, because I fancy Mr Umpelbaum is a foreigner of some
      sort&mdash;and you know they&rsquo;re all so sensitive about the superiority of
      British Art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is their nature; they can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; I pointed out. &ldquo;They try their
      best, however, to master these unworthy emotions. Sometimes, indeed, their
      dissimulation reaches a really high plane of endeavour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have nothing at all on the Continent like our Royal Academy, I am
      told,&rdquo; said Miss Timby-Hucks. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t generally known, is it? I had
      thought of saying it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a safe statement,&rdquo; I assured her. &ldquo;You might go further, and
      assert that no other country at any stage of its history has had anything
      like the Royal Academy. It is the unique blossom of British civilisation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Timby-Hucks seemed to like the phrase, and made a note of it on the
      back of her catalogue. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I thought of making my
      criticism general, dealing with things like that. But I&rsquo;ve got some
      awfully interesting figures to put in. For example, there are sixty-eight
      Academicians and Associates exhibiting: they have one hundred and
      thirty-five oil paintings, sixteen water-colour or black-and-white
      drawings, eight architectural designs, and twenty-three pieces of
      sculpture&mdash;a total of one hundred and eighty-two works of art, or two
      and sixty-seven hundredths each. I got at that by dividing the total
      number of works by the total number of Academicians. Do you think any one
      else will be likely to print that first in a daily paper? Mrs Umpelbaum
      told me that <i>Maida Vale</i> made a special point of new facts. I don&rsquo;t
      think I shall say much about the pictures themselves. What <i>is</i> there
      to say about pictures by the Academicians? As I told mamma this morning,
      they wouldn&rsquo;t be Academicians if they didn&rsquo;t paint good pictures, would
      they? and good pictures speak for themselves. Of course, I shall describe
      the subjects of Sir Frederic&rsquo;s pictures&mdash;by the way, what <i>is</i> a
      Hesperides?&mdash;and some of the others: I&rsquo;ll get you to pick out for me
      a few leading names. But I shall make my main point the splendid advance
      of lady-artists&mdash;I heard some one say in the other room there&rsquo;d never
      been half so many before&mdash;and the elevating effect this has upon
      British Art. In fact, mightn&rsquo;t I say that is what makes British Art what
      it is to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of the reasons, undoubtedly,&rdquo; I assented, as I rose. &ldquo;There are
      others, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ees, I know,&rdquo; said Miss Timby-Hucks: &ldquo;the diffusion of Christian
      principles amongst us, our high national morality, and the sanctity of the
      English home. Mrs Albert said only last night that these lay at the very
      foundation of British art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs Albert is a woman of discernment,&rdquo; I said, making a gesture of
      farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Timby-Hucks on the instant thought of something. Her eyes
      glistened, her two upper front teeth gleamed. &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s just occurred to
      me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, moving nearer to my side, and speaking-in confidential
      excitement. &ldquo;I know now how that lady-reporter manages with the
      hairdressers and dentists. She doesn&rsquo;t pay them money at all. She mentions
      their names in the papers instead. How dull of me not to have thought of
      that before! Why&mdash;yes&mdash;I will!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put my dressmaker
      among the Private View celebrities!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One likes to be civil to people who are obviously going to succeed in the
      world. I forthwith took Miss Timby-Hucks out to luncheon.

      Lines of the Greatest Resistance</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y own idea,&rdquo; said
      Uncle Dudley, &ldquo;is that women ought to be confined to barracks during
      elections just the same as soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was quite prepared to find <i>you</i> entertaining views of that
      character,&rdquo; remarked Miss Wallaby, with virginal severity. &ldquo;Men who have
      wandered about the less advanced parts of the earth, and spent long
      periods of time in contact with inferior civilisations, quite generally do
      feel that way. Life in the Colonies, and in similar rude and remote
      regions, does produce that effect upon the masculine mind. But here in
      England, the nerve-centre of the English-speaking race, the point of
      concentration from which radiate all the impulses of refinement and
      culture that distinguish our generation, men are coming to see these
      matters in a different light. They no longer refuse to listen to the
      overwhelming arguments in favour of entire feminine equality&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> admit <i>that</i> at once,&rdquo; broke in Uncle Dudley. &ldquo;But do
      women nowadays believe in equality among themselves? In my youth they used
      to devote pretty well all their energies to showing how much superior they
      were to other women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke of the masculine attitude,&rdquo; said Miss Wallaby, coldly. &ldquo;Viewed
      intelligently, the gradations and classifications which we maintain among
      ourselves, at the cost of such infinite trouble and personal
      self-sacrifice, are the very foundation upon which rests the
      superstructure of British Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit that, too,&rdquo; Uncle Dudley hastened to put in. &ldquo;Really, we are
      getting on very nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wallaby ignored the interruption altogether. &ldquo;The point is,&rdquo; she went
      on, &ldquo;that the male mind in England is coming&mdash;with characteristic
      slowness, no doubt, but still coming&mdash;to recognise the necessity of
      securing the very fullest and most complete participation of my sex in
      public affairs. As the diffusion of enlightenment progresses, men will
      more and more abandon the coarse and egoistic standards of their days of
      domination by brute force, and turn instead to the ideals of purity and
      sweetness which Woman in Politics typifies. It has been observed that one
      may pick out the future rulers of England in each coming generation by
      scanning the honour-lists of Oxford and Cambridge. How happy a day it will
      be for England, and civilisation, when this is said of Girton and Newnham
      as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spent a summer in the State of Maine once, some years ago,&rdquo; said Uncle
      Dudley. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the State, you know, where they&rsquo;ve had a Prohibition law
      now for nearly forty years. The excess of females over males is larger
      there, I believe, than it is anywhere else in the world&mdash;owing to the
      fact that all the young men who are worth their salt emigrate to some
      other State as soon as they&rsquo;ve saved up enough for a railway-ticket. The
      men that you do see lounging around there, in the small villages, are all
      minding the baby, or sitting on the doorstep shelling peas, or out in the
      backyard, with their mouths full of clothes-pins, hanging up sheets and
      pillow-cases on the line to dry. The women there take a very active part
      in politics&mdash;and every census shows that Maine&rsquo;s population has
      diminished. Shipbuilding has almost ceased, farms are being abandoned
      yearly, the State is mortgaged up to its eyebrows, and you get nothing but
      fried clams and huckleberry-pie for breakfast&mdash;but, of course, I
      suppose there <i>is</i> a good deal of purity and sweetness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wallaby rose and walked away from us; the black velvet riband around
      her neck, the glint of gas-light on her eyeglasses, the wearied
      haughtiness on her swarthy, high-nosed face, seemed to unite in saying to
      us that we were very poor creatures indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been down to the Retired Licensed Victuallers&rsquo; Division of Surrey,
      you know,&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Dudley, &ldquo;making speeches in favour of the
      sitting Member, old Sir Watkyn Hump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that accounts for the milk in the cocoa-nut,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; my friend mused aloud, &ldquo;I fancy <i>young</i> Hump accounts for
      that. See&mdash;she&rsquo;s gone and cut him out from under the Timby-Hucks&rsquo;s
      guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at one of Mrs Albert Grundy&rsquo;s evenings at home, and Uncle Dudley
      and I now had possession of a quiet corner to ourselves. From this
      pleasant vantage-ground we indolently surveyed the throng surrounding Mrs
      Albert at the piano end of the room, and stretching off through the open
      double doors into the adjoining chamber&mdash;a throng of dazzling arms
      and shoulders, of light-hued satins and fluffy stuffs, of waving feathers,
      and splendid piles of braided hair, and mostly comely faces wreathed in
      politic smiles. Here and there the mass of pinks and whites and creams was
      broken abruptly by a black coat with a hat under its sleeve. Dudley and I
      idly commented upon the fact that almost all these coats belonged to
      undersized elderly men, generally with spectacles and a grey beard, and we
      noted with placid interest that as they came in&mdash;announced in
      stentorian tones as Mr and Mrs So-and-so&mdash;their wives as a rule were
      several inches taller and many many years younger than themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was entertaining, too, to watch Mrs Albert shake hands with these
      newcomers. She knew just at what angle each preferred that ceremony,
      keeping her knuckles well down in welcoming the more sophisticated and
      up-to-date people from about Cromwell Road and the Park, but elevating
      them breast-high to greet those from around Brompton way, and hoisting
      them quite up to the chin-level with the guests from beyond Earl&rsquo;s Court,
      who were still in the toils of last year&rsquo;s fashions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart woman, that sister of mine!&rdquo; said Uncle Dudley. &ldquo;See the way she&rsquo;s
      manoeuvred her shoulder around in front of the Timby-Hucks&rsquo;s nose, so as
      to head her off from getting in and being introduced to the Hon. Mrs
      Coon-Alwyn. And&mdash;hello! by George, she&rsquo;s won!&mdash;there&rsquo;s the
      Dowager Countess of Thames-Ditton coming in! You&rsquo;ll never know the
      anguish, my boy, that was caused by the uncertainty whether she would come
      or not. Emily hasn&rsquo;t been able to eat these past four days, expecting
      every moment the knock of the postman bringing her ladyship&rsquo;s refusal to
      come. The only thing that enabled her to keep up, she said, was fixing her
      mind resolutely on the fact that the aristocracy are notoriously impolite
      about answering invitations. But now, happy woman&mdash;her cup is fairly
      running over. This is a great night for Fernbank. And&mdash;look!&mdash;hanged
      if that girl isn&rsquo;t trying to edge her way in there, too! See how prettily
      Emily managed that? Oh, Timby-Hucks! Timby-Hucks! you&rsquo;ve put your foot in
      it this time. You&rsquo;ll never figure on the free-list for <i>this</i> show
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Misfortune indeed claimed Miss Timby-Hucks for its very own. Mrs Albert
      had twice adroitly interposed her well-rounded shoulders between that
      enterprising young woman and social eminence&mdash;the second time with
      quite obvious determination of purpose. And there, too, behind the door,
      young Mr Hump bent his sloping shoulders and cliff-like collar humbly over
      Miss Wallaby&rsquo;s chair, listening with all his considerable ears to her
      selected monologues. Ah, the vanity of human aspirations!
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting an heroic glance over the field of defeat, Miss Timby-Hucks&rsquo;s eye
      lighted upon our corner, and on the instant her two upper front teeth
      gleamed in a smile of relief. At all events, <i>we</i> were left&mdash;and
      she came towards us with a decisive step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hardly seen you since the Academy,&rdquo; she said in her sprightly way to
      me, after we had all shaken hands, and she had seated herself between us
      on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did your article come out?&rdquo; I asked politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it never came out at all,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It seems it got left over
      too long. The editor <i>said</i> it was owing to the pressure of
      interesting monkey-language matter upon his columns; but <i>I</i> believe
      it was just because I&rsquo;m a lady journalist, and so does the cousin of Mrs
      Umpelbaum, the proprietor&rsquo;s wife. It must have been that&mdash;because,
      long after the editor gave this excuse, there were the daily papers still
      printing their criticisms, &lsquo;Eleventh Notice of the Royal Academy,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
      Spring Exhibitions&mdash;Fourteenth Article,&rsquo; and so on. I taxed him with
      it&mdash;told him I heard they had some still left, that they were going
      to begin printing again after the elections were over&mdash;but he said it
      was different with dailies. All <i>they</i> needed were advertisements and
      market reports, and police news, and telegrams about the Macedonian
      frontier, and they could print art criticisms and book reviews whole years
      after they should have appeared, because nobody ever read them when they
      were printed&mdash;but weeklies had to be absolutely up to date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evil luck does pursue you!&rdquo; I said, compassionately. &ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t got
      into print at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O I&rsquo;m not a bit cast down,&rdquo; replied Miss Timby-Hucks, with jaunty
      confidence. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such word as fail in my book. The way to succeed
      is just to keep pegging away. I know of one lady-journalist who went every
      day for nine weeks to interview the Countess of Wimps about her second
      son&rsquo;s having been warned off Newmarket Heath. Every day she was refused
      admittance&mdash;once she got into the hall and was put out by a brutal
      footman&mdash;but it never unnerved her. Each morning she went again. And
      she would have succeeded by this time, probably&mdash;only the Countess
      suddenly left England to spend the summer in Egypt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Wady Halfa <i>has</i> its advantages, even in July,&rdquo; said Uncle
      Dudley. &ldquo;It is warm, and there are insects, but one is allowed by law to
      kill them&mdash;in Egypt.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      <i>Illustrating the operation of Vegetables and Feminine Duplicity upon
      the Concepts of Maternal Responsibility</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> FELT that I was
      on sufficiently intimate terms with Mrs Albert Grundy to tell her that she
      was not looking well. She gave a weary little sigh and said she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, poor lady, it was apparent enough. She has taken of late to
      wearing her hair drawn up from her forehead over a roll&mdash;the effect
      of mouse-tints at which Nature is beginning to hint, being frankly helped
      out by powder. Everybody about Fernbank recognises that in some way this
      reform has altered the whole state of affairs. The very servant who comes
      to the door, or who brings in the tea-things, seems to carry herself in a
      different manner since the change has been made. Of course, it is by no
      means a new fashion, but it was not until the Dowager Countess of
      Thames-Ditton brought it in person to Fernbank that Mrs Albert could be
      quite sure of its entire suitability. Up to that time it had seemed to her
      a style rather adapted to lady lecturers and the wives of men who write:
      and though Mrs Albert has the very highest regard for literature&mdash;quite
      dotes on it, as she says&mdash;she is somewhat inclined to sniff at its
      wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all feel that the change adds character to Mrs Albert&rsquo;s face&mdash;or
      rather exhibits now that true managing and resourceful temper, which was
      formerly obscured and weakened by a fringe. But the new arrangement has
      the defects of its qualities. It does not lend itself to tricks. The
      countenance beneath it does not easily dissemble anxiety or mask fatigue.
      And both were written broadly over Mrs Albert&rsquo;s fine face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consoling suggestion that soon the necessity of giving home-dinners to
      the directors in her husband&rsquo;s companies would have ended, and that then a
      few weeks out of London, away somewhere in the air of the mountains or the
      sea, would bring back all her wonted strength and spirits, did no good.
      She shook her head and sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t physical. That is to say, it <i>is</i> physical,
      but the cause is mental. It is over-worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all people on earth&mdash;<i>you!</i>&rdquo; I replied reproachfully. &ldquo;Why
      think of it&mdash;a husband who is the dream of docile propriety, a
      competency broadening each year into a fortune, a home like this, such
      servants, such appointments, such a circle of admiring friends&mdash;and
      then your daughters! Why, to be the mother of such a girl as Ermyntrude&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs Albert. &ldquo;To be the mother of such a girl, as
      you say. Little you know what it really means! But, no&mdash;I know what
      you were going to say&mdash;<i>please</i> don&rsquo;t! it is too sad a subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could do nothing but feebly strive to look my surprise. To think of
      sadness connected with tall, handsome, good-hearted Ermie, was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I am exaggerating, I know,&rdquo; Mrs Albert went on. &ldquo;Ah, you do not
      know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be more evident,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;than that I don&rsquo;t know. I
      can&rsquo;t even imagine what on earth you are driving at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert paused for a moment, and pushed the toe of her wee slipper
      meditatively back and forth on the figure of the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I <i>will</i> tell you,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;You are such an old
      friend of the family that you are almost one of us. And besides, you are
      always sympathetic&mdash;so different from Dudley. Well, the point is
      this. You know the young man&mdash;Sir Watkyn&rsquo;s son&mdash;Mr Eustace
      Hump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met him here,&rdquo; I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I doubt if you will meet him here any more,&rdquo; Mrs Albert said,
      impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deprivation shall not drive me to despair or drink,&rdquo; I assured her.
      &ldquo;I will watch over myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you did not care much for him,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert. &ldquo;I know
      Dudley didn&rsquo;t. But, all the same, he <i>was</i> eligible. He is an only
      son, and his father is a Baronet&mdash;an hereditary title&mdash;and they
      are <i>rolling</i> in wealth. And Eustace himself, when you get to know
      him, has some very admirable qualities. You know he <i>writes!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard him say so,&rdquo; I responded, perhaps not over graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, <i>regularly</i>, for a number of weekly papers. It is understood that
      quite frequently he gets paid&mdash;not of course that that matters to him&mdash;but
      his associations are distinctly literary. I have always felt that with his
      tastes and connections his wife&mdash;granting of course that she was the
      right kind of woman&mdash;might at last set up a real literary <i>salon</i>
      in London. We have wanted one so long, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we?&rdquo; I murmured listlessly, striving all the while to guess what
      relation all this bore to the question of Ermyntrude. I built up in my
      mind a hostile picture of the odious Hump, with his shoulders sloping off
      like a German wine-bottle, his lean neck battlemented in high starched
      walls of linen, and his foolish conceited face&mdash;and leaped hopefully
      to the conclusion that Ermyntrude had rejected him. I could not keep the
      notion to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;has she sent him about his business?&rdquo; I asked, making ready to
      beam with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert, ruefully. &ldquo;It never got to that, so far as I can
      gather&mdash;but at all events it is all over. I expect every morning now
      to read the announcement in the <i>Morning Post</i> that a marriage has
      been arranged between him and&mdash;and&mdash;Miss Wallaby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat upright, and felt myself smiling. &ldquo;What!&mdash;the girl with the
      black ribbon round her neck?&rdquo; I asked comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be more appropriate round her heart,&rdquo; remarked Mrs Albert, with
      bitterness in her tone. &ldquo;Why, do you know? her mother, for all that she&rsquo;s
      Lady Wallaby, hasn&rsquo;t an &lsquo;h&rsquo; in her whole composition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, neither has old Sir Watkyn Hump,&rdquo; I rejoined pleasantly. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a
      fair exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but <i>he</i> can afford it,&rdquo; put in Mrs Albert. &ldquo;But the Wallabys&mdash;well,
      I can only say that I had a right to look for different treatment at <i>their</i>
      hands. How, do you suppose, they would ever have been asked to the Hon.
      Mrs Coon-Alwyn&rsquo;s garden-party, or met Lady Thames-Ditton, or been put in
      society generally, if I had not taken an interest in them? Why, that
      girl&rsquo;s father, old Sir Willoughby Wallaby, was never anything but chief of
      police, or something like that, out in some Australian convict settlement.
      I <i>have</i> heard he was knighted by mistake, but of course my lips are
      sealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they really have behaved badly,&rdquo; I said, half interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly!&rdquo; echoed the wrathful mother. &ldquo;I will leave you to judge. It was
      done here, quite under my own roof. You know Miss Wallaby volunteered her
      services, and went down into the Retired Licensed Victuallers&rsquo; Division of
      Surrey to electioneer for Sir Watkyn. Do you know, I never suspected
      anything. And then Miss Timby-Hucks, she went down also, but they rather
      cold-shouldered her, and she came back, and she told me things, and <i>still</i>
      I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. Well then&mdash;three weeks ago&mdash;my Evening At
      Home&mdash;you were here&mdash;the Wallabys came as large as life, and
      that scheming young person manoeuvred about until she got herself alone
      with Eustace and my Ermyntrude, and then she told her a scene she had
      witnessed during her recent election experiences. There was a meeting for
      Sir Watkyn at some place, I can&rsquo;t recall the name, and there were a good
      many of the other side there, and they hooted and shouted, and raised
      disturbance, until at last there was one speaker they would not hear at
      all. All this that girl told Ermyntrude seriously, and as if she were
      overflowing with indignation. And then she came to the part where the
      speaker stood his ground and tried to make himself heard, and the crowd
      yelled louder than ever, and still he doggedly persisted&mdash;and then
      someone threw a large vegetable marrow, soft and very ripe, and it hit
      that speaker just under the ear, and burst all over him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; I ejaculated. &ldquo;The vegetable marrow in politics is new&mdash;full
      of delightful possibilities and seeds&mdash;wonder it has never been
      thought of before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert, with a sigh. &ldquo;Ermyntrude also thought it was
      funny. She has a very keen sense of humour&mdash;quite too keen. <i>She</i>
      laughed, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Mrs Albert, with shining eyes. &ldquo;Because the story had
      been told just to trap her into laughing&mdash;because&mdash;because the
      speaker upon whom that unhappy vegetable marrow exploded was&mdash;<i>Eustace
      Hump!</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      <i>Containing Thoughts upon the Great Unknown, to which are added
      Speculations upon her Hereafter</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is not often
      that I find the time to take part in Mrs Albert Grundy&rsquo;s Thursdays&mdash;the
      third and fifth Thursdays of each month, from 4 to 6.30 P.M.&mdash;but on
      a certain afternoon pleasant weather and the sense of long-accrued
      responsibility drew me to Fernbank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really very nice, after one got there. Perhaps it would have been
      less satisfactory had escape from the drawing-room been a more difficult
      matter. Inside that formal chamber, with its blinds down-drawn to shield
      the carpet from the sun, the respectable air hung somewhat heavily about
      the assembled matronhood of Brompton and the Kensingtons. The units in
      this gathering changed from time to time&mdash;for Mrs Albert&rsquo;s circle is
      a large and growing one&mdash;but the effect of the sum remained much the
      same. The elderly ladies talked about the amiability and kindliness of the
      Duchess of Teck; and argued the Continental relationships of the Duchesses
      of Connaught and Albany, first into an apparently hopeless tangle of <i>burgs</i>
      and <i>hausens</i> and <i>zollerns</i> and <i>sweigs</i>, then
      triumphantly out again into the bright daylight of well-ordered and
      pellucid genealogy. The younger wives spoke in subdued voices of more
      juvenile Princesses on the lower steps of the throne, with occasional
      short-winged flights across the North Sea in imaginative search of a
      suitable bride for the then unwedded Duke of York, if an importation
      should be found to be necessary&mdash;about which opinions might in all
      loyalty differ. The few young girls who sat dutifully here beside their
      mammas or married sisters talked of nothing at all, but smiled confusedly
      and looked away whenever another&rsquo;s glance, caught theirs&mdash;and, I
      daresay, thought with decent humility upon Marchionesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But outside, on the garden-lawn at the rear of the house, the <i>Almanach
      de Gotha</i> threw no shadow, and the pungent scent of jasmine and lilies
      drove the leathery odour of Debrett from the soft summer air. The gentle
      London haze made Whistlers and Maitlands of the walls and roof-lines and
      chimney-pots beyond. The pretty girls of Fernbank held court here on the
      velvet grass, with groups of attendant maidens from sympathetic Myrtle
      Lodges and Cedarcrofts and Chestnut Villas&mdash;selected homesteads
      stretching all the way to remote West Kensington. They said there was no
      one left in London. Why, as I sat apart in the shade of the ivy
      overhanging the garden path, and watched this out-door panorama of the
      Grundys&rsquo; friendships, it seemed as if I had never comprehended before how
      many girls there really were in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how sweet it was to look upon these damsels, with their dainty
      sailor&rsquo;s hats of straw, their cheeks of Devon cream and damask, their tall
      and shapely forms, their profiles of faultless classical delicacy! What
      if, in time, they too must sit inside, by preference, and babble of
      royalties and the peerage, and politely uncover those two aggressive
      incisors of genteel maturity when they were asked to have a third cup of
      tea? That stage, praise heaven, should be many years removed. We will have
      no memento mori bones or tusks out here in the sunlit garden&mdash;but
      only tennis balls, and the inspiring chalk-bands on the sward, and the
      noble grace of English girlhood, erect and joyous in the open air. # Much
      as I delighted in this spectacle, it forced upon me as well a certain
      vague sense of depression. These lofty and lovely creatures were strangers
      to me. I do not mean that their names were unknown to me, or that I had
      not exchanged civil words with many of them, or that I might not be
      presented to, and affably received by, them all. The feeling was, rather,
      that if it were possible for me to marry them all, we still to the end of
      our days would remain strangers. I should never know what to say to them;
      still less should I ever be able to guess what they were thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tallest and most impressive of all the bevy&mdash;the handsome girl in
      the pale brown frock with the shirt-front and jacketed blouse, who stands
      leaning with folded hands upon her racket like an indolent Diana&mdash;why,
      I punted her about the whole reach from Sunbury to Walton during the
      better part of a week, only last summer, not to mention sitting beside her
      at dinner every evening on the houseboat. We were so much together, in
      truth, that my friends round about, as I came to know afterwards,
      canvassed among themselves the prospect of our arranging never to
      separate. Yet I feel that I do not know this girl. We are friends, yes;
      but we are not acquainted with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once&mdash;perhaps a dozen times&mdash;in driving through the
      busier of London streets, my fancy has been caught by this thing: a hansom
      whirling smartly by, the dark hood of which frames a woman&rsquo;s face&mdash;young,
      wistful, ivory-hued. It is like the flash exposure of a kodak&mdash;this
      bald instant of time in which I see this face, and comprehend that its
      gaze has met mine, and has burned into my memory a lightning picture of
      something I should not recognise if I saw it again, and cannot at all
      reproduce to myself, and probably would not like if I could, yet which
      leaves me with the feeling that I am richer than I was before. In that
      fractional throb of space there has been snatched an unrehearsed and
      unprejudiced contact of human souls&mdash;projected from one void
      momentarily to be swept forward into another; and though not the Judgment
      Day itself shall bring these two together again, they know each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I look again at the goddess in the pale-brown gown, these
      unlabelled faces of the flitting hansoms seem by comparison those of
      familiar companions and intimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I get no sense of human communion from that serene and regular
      countenance, with its exquisite nose, its short upper-lip and glint of
      pearls along the bowed line of the mouth, its correctly arched brows and
      wide-open, impassive blue eyes. I can see it with prophetic admiration
      out-queening all the others at Henley, or at Goodwood, or on the great
      staircase of Buckingham Palace. I can imagine it at Monte Carlo, flushed a
      little at the sight of retreating gold; or at the head of a great noble&rsquo;s
      table, coldly poised above satin throat and shoulders, and stirring no
      muscle under the free whisperings of His Excellency to the right. I can
      conceive it in the Divorce Court, bearing with metallic equanimity the
      rude scrutiny of a thousand unlicensed eyes. But my fancy wavers and fails
      at the task of picturing that face at my own fireside, with the light of
      the home-hearth painting the fulness of her rounded chin, and reflecting
      back from her glance, as we talk of men and books and things, the frank
      gladness of real comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But&mdash;tchut!&mdash;I have no fireside, and the comrades I like best
      are playing halfcrown whist at the club; and these are all nice girls&mdash;hearty,
      healthful, handsome girls, who can walk, run, dance, swim, scull, skate,
      ride as no others have known or dared to do since the glacial wave of
      Christianity depopulated the glades and dells of Olympus. They will mate
      after their kind, and in its own good time along will come a new
      generation of straight, strong-limbed, thin-lipped, pink-and-white girls,
      and of tow-headed, deep-chested lads, their brothers&mdash;boys who will
      bully their way through Rugby and Harrow, misspell and misapprehend their
      way into the Army, the Navy, and the Civil Service, and spread themselves
      over the habitable globe, to rule, through sheer inability to understand,
      such Baboos and Matabele and mere Irishry as Imperial destiny delivers
      over to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision is not wholly joyous, as it with diffidence projects itself
      beyond, into that further space where new strange other generations walk&mdash;the
      girls still taller and more coldly tubbed, the boys astride a yet more
      temerarious saddle of dull dominion. Reluctant prophecy discerns beneath
      their considerable feet the bruised fragments of many antique trifles&mdash;the
      <i>bric-à-brac</i> of an extinct sentimental fraction that had a sense of
      humour and could spell&mdash;and, to please mamma, the fig-leaves have
      quite overspread and hidden the statues in their garden. But power is
      there, and empire; they still more serenely loom above the little foreign
      folks who cook, and sing to harps and fiddles, and paint for their
      amusement; such as it is under their shaping, they possess the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as the sun goes down in the Hammersmith heavens, I take off my hat,
      and salute the potential mothers of the New Rome.

      <i>Glancing at some Modern Aspects of Master John Gutenberg&rsquo;s ingenious
      but Over-rated Invention</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was very
      pleasant thus to meet Uncle Dudley in the Strand. Only here and there is
      one who can bear that test. Whole legions of our friends, decent and
      deeply reputable people, fall altogether out of the picture, so to speak,
      on this ancient yet robust thoroughfare. They do very well indeed in
      Chelsea or Highgate or the Pembridge country, where they are at home:
      there the surroundings fit them to a nicety; there they produce upon one
      only amiable, or at the least, natural, impressions. But to encounter them
      in the Strand is to be shocked by the blank incongruity of things. It is
      not alone that they give the effect of being lost&mdash;of wandering
      helplessly in unfamiliar places. They offend your perceptions by revealing
      limitations and shortcomings which might otherwise have been hidden to the
      end of time. You see suddenly that they are not such good fellows, after
      all. Their spiritual complexions are made up for the dim light which
      pervades the outskirts of the four-mile radius&mdash;and go to pieces in
      the jocund radiance of the Strand. It is flat presumption on their part to
      be ambling about where the ghosts of Goldsmith and Johnson walk, where
      Prior and Fielding and our Dick Steele have passed. Instinctively you go
      by, looking the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite different with Uncle Dudley. You saw at once that he belonged
      to the Strand, as wholly as any of our scorned and scornful sisters on its
      comers, competing with true insular doggedness against German cheeks and
      raddled accents; as fully as any of its indigenous loafers, hereditary in
      their riverside haunts from Tudor times, with their sophisticated joy in
      drink and dirt, their large self-confidence grinning through rags and
      sooty grime. It seemed as if I had always associated Uncle Dudley with the
      Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing in contemplation before a brave window, wherein American
      cheese, Danish butter, Norwegian fish, Belgian eggs, German sausages,
      Hungarian bacon, French vegetables, Australian apples, and Algerian fruits
      celebrate the catholicity of the modern British diet. He turned when I
      touched his shoulder, and drew my arm through his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Uncle Dudley, &ldquo;let us take a walk along the Strand to the Law
      Courts, where I conceive that the tide of human existence gets the worst
      of it with unequalled regularity and dispatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his way he told me that his gout had quite vanished, owing to his
      foresight in collecting a large store of the best medical advice, and then
      thoughtfully and with pains disregarding it all. He demonstrated to me at
      two halting places that his convalescence was compatible with rich and
      strong drinks. He disclosed to me, as we sauntered eastward, his purpose
      in straying thus far afield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Mrs Albert is really a kindly soul,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in her
      to keep angry. You remember how sternly she swore that she and Fernbank
      had seen the last of Miss Timby-Hucks. It only lasted five weeks&mdash;and
      now, bless me if the girl isn&rsquo;t more at home on our backs than ever. She&rsquo;s
      shunted herself off, now, into a new branch of journalism&mdash;it seems
      that there are a good many branches in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been noticed,&rdquo; I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t write any more,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that is, <i>for</i> the
      papers. She goes instead to the Museum or somewhere, and reads carefully
      every daily and weekly journal, I believe, in England. Her business is to
      pick out possible libels in them&mdash;and to furnish her employers, a
      certain firm of solicitors, with a daily list of these. They communicate
      with the aggrieved people, notifying them that they <i>are</i> aggrieved,
      which they very likely would not otherwise have known, and the result is,
      of course, a very fine and spirited crop of litigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that accounts for all the recent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not quite <i>all</i>,&rdquo; put in Uncle Dudley. &ldquo;But the Timby-Hucks
      is both energetic and vigilant, and she tells me she is doing splendidly.
      She is very enthusiastic about it, naturally. She says that while the
      money is, of course, an object, her real satisfaction is in the
      humanitarian aspects of her work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I follow,&rdquo; I said doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t altogether myself at the start,&rdquo; said Uncle Dudley, &ldquo;but as
      she explains it, it is very simple. You see business is in a bad way in
      London&mdash;worse, they say, than usual. The number of unemployed is
      something dreadful to think of, so I am told by those who have thought of
      it. There are many thousands of people with no food, no fire, no clothes
      to speak of. Most people are discouraged about this. They can&rsquo;t see how
      the thing can be improved. But Miss Timby-Hucks has a very ingenious idea.
      Why, she asks, do not all the Unemployed sue all the newspapers for libel?
      Do you catch the notion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;that is a bold, comprehensive thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried Uncle Dudley. &ldquo;I am immensely attracted by it. For
      one thing, it is so secure, so certain! Broadly speaking, there are no
      risks at all. I suppose there has never yet been a case, no matter what
      its so-called merits, in which the English newspaper hasn&rsquo;t been cast in
      damages of some sort Nobody is too humble or too shady to get a verdict
      against an editor or newspaper proprietor. Miss Timby-Hucks relates
      several most touching instances where the wolf was actually at the door,
      the children shoeless and hungry, the mother prostrated by drink, rain
      coming through the roof and so on&mdash;and everything has been changed to
      peace and contentment by the happy thought of bringing a libel suit. The
      father now wears a smile and a white waistcoat; the drains have been
      repaired; the little children, nicely washed and combed, kick each other&rsquo;s
      shins with brand new boots, and sing cheerfully beneath a worsted-work
      motto of &lsquo;God bless our Home!&rsquo; I find myself much affected by the
      thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had always a tender heart,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;I suppose there would be no
      trouble about the Judges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world,&rdquo; said Uncle Dudley, with confidence. &ldquo;Of
      course the Bench would have to be greatly enlarged, but there need be no
      fear on that score. There is a mysterious but beneficent rule, my boy,
      which you can always count upon in this making of judges&mdash;no matter
      how hail-fellow-well-met an eminent lawyer may be, no matter how intimate
      his connection with newspapers, how large his indebtedness to them for his
      career&mdash;the moment he gets on the Bench he catches the full, fine,
      old-crusted judicial spirit toward the Press. The scales fall with a bang
      from his eyes, and he sees the editor and newspaper proprietor as they
      really are&mdash;designing criminals, mercenary reprobates, social pests&mdash;to
      be lectured and bullied and put down. O, you may rely on the Judges! They
      are as safe as a new Liberal peer is to vote Tory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the &lsquo;power of the Press&rsquo;?&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;If the newspapers combine in
      protest, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk at random!&rdquo; said Uncle Dudley almost austerely. &ldquo;I should say
      the most certain, the most absolutely reliable, element in the whole case
      is the fact that newspapers do not combine. Whenever one editor gets hit,
      all the others grin. One journal is mulcted in heavy damages: the rest
      have all a difficulty in dissembling their delight. You read in natural
      history that kites are given to falling upon one of their kind which gets
      wounded or decrepit, and picking out its eyes. Well, kites are also made
      of newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And juries?&rdquo; I began to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; remarked Uncle Dudley, turning in toward the guarded
      portals of the great hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a friend among the attendants here, a thoughtful and discerning
      man. I will learn from him where we may look for the spiciest case. He
      takes a lively interest in the flaying of editors. I believe he was once a
      printer. He will tell us where the axe gleams most savagely to-day: where;
      we shall get the most journalistic blood for our money. You were speaking
      of juries. Just take a look at one of them&mdash;if you are not afraid of
      spoiling your luncheon&mdash;and you will see that they speak for
      themselves. They regard all newspapers as public enemies&mdash;particularly
      when the betting tips have been more misleading than usual. They stand by
      their kind. They &lsquo;give the poor man a chance&rsquo; without hesitation, without
      fail. They are here to avenge the discovery of movable types, and they do
      it. Come with me, and witness the disembowelling of a daily, the
      hamstringing of a sub-editor&mdash;a publisher felled by the hand of the
      Law like a bullock. Since the bear-pits of Bankside were closed there has
      been no such sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, it turned out that none of the Judges had come down to the
      Courts that day. There was a threat of east wind in the air. &ldquo;You see, if
      they don&rsquo;t live, to a certain age they get no pensions, and their heirs
      turn a key in the lock on the old gentlemen in weather like this,&rdquo;
       explained Uncle Dudley, turning disappointedly away.

      Albert, &ldquo;that I am as free to admit my errors in judgment as another.
      Evidently there has been a mistake in this matter, and it is equally
      obvious that I am the one who must have made it. I did not need to have
      this pointed out to me, Dudley. What I looked to you for was advice,

    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>And</i> the scarlet petticoat,&rdquo; prompted Uncle Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>And</i> the crinoline,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, he did not insist upon that. I recall his exact words. &lsquo;Whether this
      under-garment,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;be made of some stiff material like horsehair,
      or by means of steel hoops, is a mere question of detail.&rsquo; No, Albert
      expressly kept an open mind on that point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; remarked Mrs Albert coldly, &ldquo;to the extent that he
      certainly does keep his mind on it. He has now reverted to the subject, I
      should think, at least twenty times. I am not so blind as you may imagine.
      I notice that that Mr Labouchere also keeps on referring, every week, to
      another girl in <i>her</i> zouave jacket, whom <i>he</i> remembers with
      equal fondness, apparently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Uncle Dudley, &ldquo;those words about the &lsquo;stiff material like
      horsehair&rsquo; <i>were</i> in <i>Truth</i>. I daresay Albert simply read them
      there, and just unconsciously repeated them. We often do inadvertent,
      unthinking things of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert shook her head. &ldquo;It is nothing to me, of course,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;but I cannot help feeling that the middle-aged father of a family might
      concentrate his thoughts upon something nobler, something higher, than the
      recollection of the charms of a red petticoat, thirty years ago. That is
      so characteristic of men. They cannot discuss a question broadly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not?&rdquo; queried Uncle Dudley, with interest. &ldquo;You should listen at
      the keyhole sometime, after you have led the ladies out from dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean personally, in a general way. They always particularise. Albert,
      for example, allows all his views on this very important question to be
      coloured by the fact that when he was a young man he admired some girl in
      a short red Balmoral petticoat. Whenever conversation touches upon any
      phase of the whole subject of costume, out he comes with his tiresome
      adulation of that particular garment. Of course, I ask no questions&mdash;I
      should prefer not to be informed&mdash;I try not even to draw inferences&mdash;but
      I notice that Ermyntrude is beginning to observe the persistency with
      which her father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Emily,&rdquo; urged Uncle Dudley, consolingly, &ldquo;far back in the Sixties
      we all liked that girl; we couldn&rsquo;t help ourselves&mdash;she was the only
      girl there was. And we think of her fondly still&mdash;we old fellows&mdash;because
      for us she was also the last there was! When she went out, lo and behold!
      we too had gone out, not to come back any more. When Albert and I babble
      about a scarlet petticoat, it is only as a symbol of our own far-away
      youth. O delicious vision!&mdash;the bright, bright red, the skirt that
      came drooping down over it, not hiding too much that pretty little foot
      and ankle, the dear zouave jacket moulding itself so delicately to the
      persuasive encircling arm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dudley! I really must recall you to yourself,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert. &ldquo;We were
      speaking of quite another matter. I am in a very serious dilemma. First of
      all, as I explained to you, to please the Hon. Mrs Coon-Alwyn I became one
      of the Vice-Presidents of the Friendly Divided Skirt Association. You know
      how useful she can be, in helping to bring Ermyntrude out successfully.
      And of course everybody <i>knew</i> that, even if we <i>did</i> have them
      <i>made</i>, we should never <i>wear</i> them. That was <i>quite</i> out
      of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked Uncle Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let me see&mdash;yes, next came the Neo-Dress-Improver
      League. I never understood what the object was, precisely; it was a kind
      of secession from the other, led by the Countess of Wimps, and I needn&rsquo;t
      tell you that she is of the <i>utmost</i> importance to us, and there was
      simply <i>nothing</i> for me to do but to become a Lady Patroness of <i>that</i>.
      You were in extremely nice company&mdash;there were seven or eight ladies
      of title among the Patronesses, our names all printed together in
      beautiful little gilt letters&mdash;and you really weren&rsquo;t committed to
      anything that I could make out. No&mdash;<i>that</i> was all right. I
      should do the same thing again, under the circumstances. No, the trouble
      came with the Amalgamated Anti-Crinoline Confederacy. That was where I was
      too hasty, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing with the protesting post-cards, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; inquired
      Uncle Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That very feature of it alone ought to have warned me,&rdquo; Mrs Albert
      answered with despondency. &ldquo;My own better sense should have told me that
      post-cards were incompatible with selectness. But you see, the invitations
      were sent out by the authoress of <i>The Street-Sprinkler&rsquo;s Secret</i>,
      and that gave me the impression that it was to be literary&mdash;to
      represent Culture and the Arts, you know; and that appealed to me, of
      course, very strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always feared that your literary impulses would run away with
      you,&rdquo; Uncle Dudley declared gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my weak side; I don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; replied his sister. &ldquo;Where letters
      and authorship, and that sort of thing, you know, are concerned, it is my
      nature to be sympathetic. And besides, the Dowager Lady Thames-Ditton was
      very pronounced in favour of the movement, and I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> fly in
      the face of that, could I? I must say, though, that I had my misgivings
      almost from the first. Miss Wallaby told the Rev. Mr Grayt-Scott that a
      lady she knew had looked over quite a peck or more of the post-cards which
      came in one day, and they were nine-tenths of them from Earl&rsquo;s Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Uncle Dudley, &ldquo;I think I have heard that the post-card
      reaches its most luxuriant state of literary usefulness in that locality.
      It was from that point that they tried to rush the Laureateship, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can imagine how I felt when I heard it. It is all well enough
      to be literary&mdash;nobody realises that more than I do&mdash;and it is
      all very well to be loyal&mdash;of course! But one draws the line at
      Earl&rsquo;s Court&mdash;at least, that part of it. I say frankly that it serves
      me right. I should have known better. One thing I cannot be too thankful
      for&mdash;Ermyntrude did not send a post-card. Some blessed instinct
      prompted me to tell her there was no hurry about it&mdash;that I did not
      like to see young girls too forward in such matters. And now&mdash;why&mdash;who
      knows&mdash;Dudley! I have an idea! Ermie shall join the Crinoline Defence
      League!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;the family will hedge on the crinoline issue. Capital!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, after all, we may have to wear them. It&rsquo;s quite as likely as
      not. The old Duchess of West Ham is President of the League, and she is
      very influential in the highest quarters. Her Grace, I understand, <i>is</i>
      somewhat bandy, but she has always maintained the strictest Christian
      respectability, and her action in this matter will count for a great deal.
      Just think, if she should happen to take a fancy to Ermyntrude! That Miss
      Wallaby has thrust herself forward till she is actually a member of the
      Council, and she is going to deliver an address on &lsquo;The Effect of Modesty
      on National Morals.&rsquo; She told our curate that at one of the meetings of
      the Council she came within an ace of being introduced to the Duchess
      herself. Now surely, if <i>she</i> can accomplish all this, Ermie ought to
      be able to do still more. Tell me, Dudley, what do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Uncle Dudley musingly, &ldquo;I think that the scarlet
      petticoat, <i>with</i> the zouave jack&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert interrupted him with sternness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; she demanded,
      &ldquo;that if it <i>does</i> come, the dear girl will share in the credit of
      bringing it in, and if it doesn&rsquo;t come, I shall have the advantage of
      having helped to stave it off. Whichever side wins, there we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley rose, and looked thoughtfully out upon the fog, and stroked
      his large white moustache in slow meditation. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;undoubtedly,&rdquo; he
      said at last, &ldquo;there we are.&rdquo;

      <i>Dealing with the Deceptions of Nature, and the Freedom from, Illusion
      Inherent in the Unnatural</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was once a
      woman&mdash;obviously a thoughtful woman&mdash;who remarked that she had
      noticed that if she managed to live till Friday, she invariably survived
      the rest of the week. I did not myself know this philosopher, who is
      preserved to history in one of Roscoe Conkling&rsquo;s speeches, but her
      discovery always recurs to me about this time of year, when February
      begins to disclose those first freshening glimpses of sunlight and blue
      skies to bleared, fog-smudged and shivering London. Aha! if we have won
      thus far, if we have contrived to get to February, then we shall surely
      see the Spring. At least the one has heretofore involved the other&mdash;and
      there is confident promise in the smile of a noon-day once more able to
      cast a shadow, albeit the teeth of the east wind gleam close behind that
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a day for a walk&mdash;no set and joyous rural tramp, indeed, with
      pipe and wallet, and a helpful spring underfoot in the clean hard roadway,
      and an honest, well-balanced stick for the bell-ringing gentry who shall
      come at you on wheels from behind&mdash;but just an orderly, contemplative
      urban ramble, brisk enough for warmth, but with no hurry, and above all no
      destination. And it was a day, moreover, for letting one&rsquo;s
      fellow-creatures pass along with scant notice&mdash;a winter-ridden,
      shuffling, mud-stained company these, conscious of being not at all worth
      examination&mdash;and for giving eye instead to the house-fronts in the
      sunshine, and radiant chimneypots and tiles above them, and the signs of
      blessed, unaccustomed blue still further up. There was, it is true, an
      undeniable disproportion between the inner look of these things, and this
      gladness of the heart because of them. Glancing more closely, one could
      see that they were not taking the sun seriously, and, for their own part,
      were expecting more fogs next week. And farther westward, when stucco,
      brick, and stone gave way to park-land, it was apparent at sight that the
      trees were flatly incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      They say that in Ireland, where the mildness of climate has in the past
      prompted many experiments with exotic growths, the trees not really
      indigenous to the island never learn sense, but year after year are gulled
      by this February fraud into gushing expansively forth with sap and tender
      shoots, only to be gripped and shrivelled by the icy after-hand of March.
      The native tree, however, knows this trick of old, and greets the sham
      Spring with a distinctive, though well-buttoned-up wink. In Kensington
      Park region one couldn&rsquo;t be sure that the trees really saw the joke. It is
      not, on the whole, a humourous neighbourhood. But at all events they were
      not to be fooled into premature buds and sprouts and kindred signs of
      silliness. Every stiffly exclusive drab trunk rising before you, every
      section of the brown lacework of twigs up above, seemed to offer a warning
      advertisement: &ldquo;No connection with the sunshine over the way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happily the flower-beds exhibited more sympathy. Up through the mould
      brave little snowdrops had pushed their pretty heads, and the crocuses,
      though with their veined outer cloaks of sulphur, mauve, and other tints
      still wrapped tight about them, wore almost a swaggering air to show how
      wholly they felt at home. Emboldened by this bravado, less confident
      fellows were peeping forth, though in such faltering fashion that one
      could scarcely tell which was squill, which narcissus or loitering
      jonquil. Still, it was good to see them. They too were glad that they had
      lived till February, because after that comes the Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was better still, as I turned to stroll on, to behold coming toward
      me down the path, with little swinging step, and shapely head well up in
      air, none other than our Ermyntrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say &ldquo;our&rdquo; because&mdash;it is really absurd to think of it&mdash;it
      seems only a few months ago since she was a sprawling tom-boy sort of a
      little girl, who sat on my knee and listened with her mouth open to my
      reminiscences of personal encounters with unicorns and the behemoth of
      Holy Writ. She must be now&mdash;by George! she <i>is</i>&mdash;not a
      minute under two-and-twenty. And that means&mdash;<i>hélas!</i> it
      undoubtedly means&mdash;that I am getting to be an old boy indeed. At
      Christmas-tide&mdash;I recall it now&mdash;Mrs Albert spoke of me as the
      oldest friend of the family. It sounded kindly at the time, and I had a
      special pleasure in the smile Ermyntrude wore as she, with the others,
      lifted her glass towards me. I won&rsquo;t say what vagrant thoughts and
      ambitions that smile did not raise in my mind&mdash;and, lo! they were
      toasting me as an amiable elderly friend of the Fernbank household. No
      wonder I am glad to have lived till February!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ermyntrude had a roll of music in her hands. There was a charming glow on
      her cheeks, and a healthy, happy, sparkle in her eyes. She stopped short
      before me, with a little exclamation of not displeased surprise!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how nice to run upon you like this,&rdquo; she said, in high spirits. &ldquo;We
      thought you must have gone off to the Riviera, or Algiers, or somewhere&mdash;for
      your cold, you know. Mamma was speaking of you only yesterday&mdash;hoping
      that you were taking care of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I a cold?&rdquo; I asked absently. The air had grown chillier. We walked
      along together, and she let me carry the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t heard,&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;such news as I have
      for you! You couldn&rsquo;t ever guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it something about crinoline?&rdquo; I queried. &ldquo;Your mother was telling
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Ermyntrude gaily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind had really got round into the East, and I, fastened my coat at
      the collar. &ldquo;I am sure&rdquo;&mdash;I remarked at last&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
      congratulate&mdash;the happy young man. Do I know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s what you might
      call rather sudden. We haven&rsquo;t known him ourselves very long&mdash;that
      is, intimately. You may have heard his name&mdash;the Honourable
      Knobbeleigh Jones. It&rsquo;s a very old family though the title is somewhat
      new. His father is Lord Skillyduff, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shipping man?&rdquo; I said, wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He and papa are together on some board or other. That is how we came
      to know them. Papa says he never saw such business ability and sterling
      worth combined in one man before&mdash;I&rsquo;m speaking of the father, you
      know. He began life in quite a small way, with just a few ships that he
      rented, or something like that. Then there was a war on some coast in
      Africa or Australia&mdash;it begins with an A, I know&mdash;oh, <i>is</i>
      there a place called Ashantee?&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;and he got the
      contract to take out four shiploads of hay to our troops&mdash;it would be
      for their horses, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: the asses connected with the military branch are needed at home&mdash;or
      at least are kept there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after he started, he got orders to stop at some place and wait for
      other orders. He did so, and he waited four years and eight months. Those
      orders never came. The hay all rotted, of course: the ships almost moulded
      away: I daresay some of the crew died of old age&mdash;But Mr Jones never
      stirred from his post. Finally, some English official came on him by
      accident&mdash;quite! and so he was recalled. Papa says very few men would
      have shown such tenacity of purpose and grasp of the situation. Mamma says
      his fidelity to duty was magnificent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent&mdash;yes,&rdquo; I commented; &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless you! there <i>was</i> no war <i>then</i>,&rdquo; explained
      Ermyntrude. &ldquo;The war had been ended for <i>years</i>. And all that while
      the pay for shipping that hay had been going on, so that the Government
      owed him&mdash;I think it was £45,000. Of course he got more contracts,
      and then he was made a baronet, and could build his own ships; and now he
      is a lord, and papa says the War Office would be quite helpless without
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the son,&rdquo; I asked; &ldquo;what does he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing, of course!&rdquo; said Ermyntrude, lifting her pretty brows a
      little in surprise. &ldquo;He is the eldest son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know but he might have gone in for the Army, or Parliament, or
      something,&rdquo; I explained weakly: &ldquo;just to occupy his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled to herself&mdash;somewhat grimly, I thought. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,
      assuming a serious face, &ldquo;he says doing things is all rot, if you aren&rsquo;t
      obliged to do them. Of course, he goes in for hunting and shooting and all
      that, and he has a houseboat and a yacht, and one year he was in the
      All-Slumpshire eleven, but that was too much bother. He hates bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had come out upon the street now, and walked for a little in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ermie,&rdquo; I said at last, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t be annoyed with me&mdash;this is one
      of my sentimental days, and you know as an old friend of the family I&rsquo;ve a
      certain right of free speech&mdash;but this doesn&rsquo;t seem to me quite good
      enough. A girl like you&mdash;beautiful and clever and accomplished,
      knowing your way about among books, and with tastes above the ruck&mdash;there
      ought to be a better outlook for you than this! I know that type of young
      man, and he isn&rsquo;t in your street at all. Come now!&rdquo; I went on, gathering
      courage, &ldquo;look me in the face if you can, and tell me that you honestly
      love this young man, or that you really respect his father, or that you
      candidly expect to be happy. I defy you to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was wrong. Ermyntrude did look me in the face, squarely and without
      hesitation. She halted for the moment to do so, and her gaze, though not
      unkindly, was full of serious frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing I do expect,&rdquo; she said, calmly. &ldquo;I expect to get away
      from Fernbank.&rdquo;

      particular question is put. As like as not he&rsquo;d throw something at you.&rdquo;
       She spoke earnestly, in low, impressive tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wild horses should not drag it from me,&rdquo; I pledged myself. &ldquo;I will not
      encourage him: I will not enrage him; I swear not to ask him what he did
      it for. But&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;could I, so to speak, bear the
      shock of learning what it is that he <i>has</i> done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard?&rdquo; Mrs Albert asked, glancing up at me, with an
      astonished face, as I stood on the stairs. When I shook my head, she put
      out her hand to the latch, and opened the door, as if to heighten the
      dramatic suspense. Then she turned and looked me in the eye with solemn
      intentness. &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; she echoed in a hollow voice: &ldquo;You go
      upstairs and see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed behind her, and I made my way noiselessly, two steps at a
      time, to the floor above. Some vague sense of disaster seemed to brood
      over the silent, half-lighted stairway and the deserted landing. I knocked
      at Uncle Dudley&rsquo;s door&mdash;almost prepared to find my signal unanswered.
      But no, his voice came back, cheerily enough, and I entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; said my friend, rising from his chair. &ldquo;Glad to see you,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      we shook hands. Standing thus, I found myself staring into his face with a
      rude and prolonged fixity of gaze, under which he first smiled&mdash;a
      strange, unwholesome sort of smile&mdash;then flushed a little, then
      scowled and averted his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; I exclaimed at last. &ldquo;Why, man alive, what on earth
      possessed you to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now!&rdquo; broke in Uncle Dudley, with peremptory sternness. &ldquo;Chuck it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know&rdquo;&mdash;I stammered haltingly along&mdash;&ldquo;I promised I
      wouldn&rsquo;t ask you&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the original simian instincts triumph over your resolutions, eh?&rdquo;
       said my friend, crustily. &ldquo;Yes, I know. I&rsquo;ve had pretty nearly a week of
      it now. That question has been asked me, I estimate, somewhere about six
      hundred and seventy-eight times since last Thursday. It&rsquo;s only fair to you
      to tell you that I have registered a vow to hit the next man who asks me
      that fool of a question&mdash;&lsquo;What did you do it for?&rsquo;&mdash;straight
      under his left ear. I probably saved your life by interrupting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the words were fierce, there was a marked return of geniality in
      the tone. I took the liberty of putting a hand over Uncle Dudley&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and marching him across to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a good look at you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it myself; I did it with my little hatchet; I did it because I
      wanted to; I had a right to do it; I should do it again if the fit struck
      me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Thus, with mock gravity, Uncle Dudley ran on as I
      scrutinised his countenance in the strong light. &ldquo;And furthermore,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care one single hurrah in Hades whether you like it or
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think on the whole,&rdquo; I mused aloud&mdash;&ldquo;yes, I think I rather do like
      it&mdash;now that I accustom myself to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley&rsquo;s face brightened on the instant. &ldquo;Do you really?&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, and beamed upon me. In spite of his professed indifference to
      my opinion, it was obvious that I had pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;there are the matches behind you&mdash;hope
      these aren&rsquo;t too green for you. Yes, my boy, I created quite a flutter in
      the hen-yard, I can tell you. Did my sister tell you?&mdash;she nearly
      fainted, and little Amy burst out boo-hooing as if she&rsquo;d lost her last
      friend. When you come to think of it, old man, it&rsquo;s really too ridiculous,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly has its grotesque aspects,&rdquo; I admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley looked up sharply, as if suspecting some ironical meaning in
      my words. &ldquo;You really do think it&rsquo;s an improvement?&rdquo; he asked, with a
      doubtful note in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it makes a tremendous change,&rdquo; I said, diplomatically, &ldquo;and
      the novelty tends perhaps to confuse judgment: but I must confess the
      result is&mdash;is, well, very interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend did not look wholly satisfied. &ldquo;It shows what stupid people we
      are,&rdquo; he went on in a dogmatic way. &ldquo;Why, the way they&rsquo;ve gone on, you&rsquo;d
      think I had no property rights in the thing at all&mdash;that I was merely
      a trustee for it&mdash;bound to give an account to every
      Tom-Dick-and-Harry who came along and had nothing better to occupy his
      mind with. And then that eternal, vacuous, woollen-brained &lsquo;What did you
      do it for?&rsquo; Oh, that&rsquo;s got to be too sickening for words! And the
      confounded familiarity of the whole thing! Why, hang me, if even the
      little Jew cigar dealer down on the corner didn&rsquo;t feel entitled to pass
      what he took to be some friendly remarks on the subject. &lsquo;Vy,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;if I could say vidout vlattery, vot a haddsobe jeddlebad you ver, and vy
      did you do dot by yourself?&rsquo; It gets on a man&rsquo;s nerves, you know, things
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hasn&rsquo;t anyone liked the change?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; he said, dubiously. &ldquo;Only
      two men have said they liked it&mdash;and it happens that they are both
      persons of conspicuously weak intellect. That&rsquo;s rather up against me,
      isn&rsquo;t it? But on the other hand, you know, people who are silliest about
      everything else always get credit for knowing the most about art and
      beauty and all that. Perhaps in such a case as this, I daresay their
      judgment might be better than all the others. And after all, what do <i>I</i>
      care? That&rsquo;s the point I make: that it&rsquo;s <i>my</i> business and nobody
      else&rsquo;s. If a man hasn&rsquo;t got a copyright in his own personal appearance,
      why there is no such thing as property. But instead of recognising this,
      any fellow feels free to come up and say: &lsquo;You look like an unfrocked
      priest,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hullo! another burglar out of work,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;s quite surprised
      if you fail to show that you&rsquo;re pleased with the genial brilliancy of his
      remarks. I don&rsquo;t suppose there is any other single thing which the human
      race lapses into such rude and insolent meddlesomeness over as it does
      over this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> pathetic,&rdquo; I admitted&mdash;&ldquo;but&mdash;but it&rsquo;ll soon grow
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley laughed a bitter laugh. &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more than
      half a mind not to let it. It would serve &lsquo;em right if I didn&rsquo;t. Why, do
      you know&mdash;you&rsquo;d hardly believe it! My sister had a dinner party on
      here for Saturday night, and after I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d done it&mdash;she
      cancelled the invitations&mdash;some excuse about a family loss&mdash;a
      bereavement, my boy. Well, you know, treatment of that sort puts a man on
      his mettle. I&rsquo;m entitled to resent it. And besides&mdash;you know&mdash;of
      course it does make a great change&mdash;but somehow I fancy that when you
      get used to it&mdash;come now&mdash;the straight griffin, as they say&mdash;what
      do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on oath not to encourage you,&rdquo; I made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have it!&rdquo; cried Uncle Dudley: &ldquo;the old tyrannical conspiracy
      against the unusual, the individual, the true! Let nobody dare to be
      himself! Let us have uniformity, if all else perishes. The frames must be
      alike in the Royal Academy, that&rsquo;s the great thing; the pictures don&rsquo;t
      matter so much. You see our women-folk now, this very month, getting ready
      to case themselves in ugly hoops which they hate, at the bidding of they
      know not whom, because, if they did not, the hideous possibility of one
      woman being different from another woman would darken the land. A man is
      not to be permitted the pitiful privilege of seeing his own mouth, not
      even once in fifteen years, simply because it temporarily inconveniences
      the multitude in their notions as to how he is in the habit of looking!
      What rubbish it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> rubbish,&rdquo; I assented&mdash;&ldquo;and you are talking it. Your
      sister who fainted, your niece who wept, your friends who averted their
      gaze in anguish, the hordes of casual jackasses who asked why you did it,
      the kindly little Jew cigar man who broke forth in lamentations&mdash;these
      are the world&rsquo;s jury. They have convicted you&mdash;sorrowfully but
      firmly. You yourself, for all your bravado, realise the heinousness of
      your crime. You are secretly ashamed, remorseful, penitent. I answer for
      you&mdash;you will never do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it isn&rsquo;t such a bad mouth, either,&rdquo; mused Uncle Dudley, with a
      lingering glance at the mirror over the mantel. &ldquo;There is humour, delicacy
      of perception, affection, gentleness&mdash;ever so many nice qualities
      about it which were all hidden up before. The world ought to welcome the
      revelation&mdash;and it throws stones instead. Ah well!&mdash;pass the
      matches&mdash;let us yield gracefully to the inevitable! It shall grow
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs Albert will be so glad,&rdquo; I remarked.

      <i>Narrating the Failure of a Loyal Attempt to Circumvent Adversity by

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f his name was
      Jabez, why weren&rsquo;t we told so, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo; demanded Mrs Albert of
      me, with a momentary flash in her weary glance. &ldquo;What right had the papers
      to go on calling him J. Spencer, year after year, while he was deluding
      the innocent, and fattening upon the bodies of his dupes? To be sure, now
      that the mask is off, and he has fled, they speak of him always as Jabez.
      Why didn&rsquo;t they do it before, while honest people might still have been
      warned? But no&mdash;they never did&mdash;and now it&rsquo;s too late&mdash;too
      late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady&rsquo;s voice broke pathetically upon this reiterated plaint. She
      bowed her head, and as I looked with pained sympathy upon the drooping
      angle of her proud face, I could see the shadows about her lips quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sad tale indeed it was, to which I had been listening&mdash;here in a
      lonesome corner of the cloistral, dim-lit solitude of the big drawing-room
      at Fernbank. It was not a new story. Kensington has known it by heart for
      a generation. Bloomsbury learned it earlier, and before that it was
      familiar in Soho&mdash;away off in the old days when the ruffling gentry
      of Golden Square fought for the chance of buying ingenious John Law&rsquo;s
      South Sea scrip. And even then, the experience was an ancient and
      half-forgotten memory of Bishopsgate and the Minories. It was the old, old
      tragedy of broken fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert was clear that it began with the Liberator troubles. I had my
      own notion that Mr Albert Grundy was skating on thin ice before the
      collapse of the building societies came. However that may be, there was no
      doubt whatever that the cumulative Australian disasters had finished the
      business. There were melancholy details in her recital which I lack the
      courage to dwell upon. The horse and brougham were gone; the lease of
      Fernbank itself was offered for sale, with possession before Michaelmas,
      if desired; Ermyntrude&rsquo;s engagement was as good as off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a bankruptcy,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert, lifting her face and
      resolutely winking the moisture from her lashes. &ldquo;We shall escape that&mdash;but
      for the moment at least I must abandon my position in society. Dudley is
      over to-day looking at a small place in Highgate, although Albert thinks
      he would prefer Sydenham. My own feeling is that some locality from which
      you could arrive by King&rsquo;s Cross or St Paneras would be best. One never
      meets anybody one knows there. Then, when matters adjust themselves again,
      as of course they will, we could return here&mdash;to this neighbourhood,
      at least&mdash;and just mention casually having been out at our country
      place&mdash;on the children&rsquo;s account, of course. And Floribel <i>is</i>
      delicate, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, then,&rdquo; I said, trying to put buoyance into my tone, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t so
      had after all. And you feel&mdash;Albert feels&mdash;quite hopeful about
      things coming right again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend&rsquo;s answering nod of affirmation had a certain qualifying dubiety
      about it. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re hopeful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But a fortnight ago, I felt
      positively sanguine. Nobody ever worked harder than I did to deserve
      success, any way. I only failed through gross treachery&mdash;and that,
      too, at the hands of the very people of whom I could never, <i>never</i>
      have believed it. When you find the aristocracy openly actuated by
      mercenary motives, as I have done this past month, it almost makes you ask
      what the British nation is coming to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;is it as bad as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge for yourself,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert gravely. &ldquo;You know that I
      organised&mdash;quite early in the Spring&mdash;the Loyal Ladies&rsquo; Namesake
      Committee of Kensington. I do not boast in saying that I really organised
      it, quite from its beginnings. The idea was mine; practically all the
      labour was mine. But when one is toiling to realise a great ideal like
      that, one frequently loses sight of small details. I ought to have known
      better&mdash;but I took a serpent to my bosom. I was weak enough to
      associate with me in the enterprise that monument of duplicity and
      interested motives&mdash;the Hon. Mrs Coon-Alwyn. Why, she hadn&rsquo;t so much
      as an initial letter to entitle her to belong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I follow you,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Namesake Committee&mdash;initial
      letter&mdash;I don&rsquo;t seem to grasp the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly simple,&rdquo; explained Mrs Albert. &ldquo;The idea was that all the
      ladies&mdash;our set, you know&mdash;whose name was &lsquo;May&rsquo; should combine
      in subscribing for a present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your name is Emily,&rdquo; I urged, thoughtlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we weren&rsquo;t exactly literal about it,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert; &ldquo;we <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
      be, you know. It would have shut out some of our very best people. But I
      came very near the standard, indeed. My second name is Madge. You take the
      first two letters of that, and the &lsquo;y&rsquo; from Emily, and there you have it.
      Oh, I assure you, very few came even as near it as that&mdash;and as I
      said to Dudley at the time, if you think of it, even <i>her</i> name isn&rsquo;t
      <i>really</i> May. It&rsquo;s only a popular contraction. But that Hon. Mrs
      Coon-Alwyn, she had no actual right whatever to belong. Her names are
      Hester Winifred Edith. She hasn&rsquo;t even one <i>letter</i> right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was indeed treachery!&rdquo; I ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, that, was not what I referred to,&rdquo; Mrs Albert set me right. &ldquo;Of
      course, I was aware of her names. I had seen them in the &lsquo;Peerage&rsquo; for
      years. It was what she did after her entrance that covers her with infamy.
      But I will narrate the events in their order. First, we collected £1100.
      Of course, our own contribution was not large, but Ermyntrude and I hunted
      the various church registers&mdash;we don&rsquo;t speak of it, but even the
      Nonconformist ones we went through&mdash;and we got a tremendous number of
      Christian names more or less what was desired, and our circulars were sent
      to <i>every one</i>, far and near. As I said, we raised quite £1100. Then
      there came the question of the gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Albert uttered this last sentence with such deliberate solemnity that
      I bowed to show my consciousness of its importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;the selection of the gift. Now I had in mind a most
      appropriate and useful present. Have you heard of the Oboid Oil Engine?
      No? Well, it is an American invention, and has been brought over here by
      an American, who has bought the European rights from the inventor. He is
      in the next building to Albert, in the City, and they meet almost every
      day at luncheon, and have struck up quite a friendship. He has connections
      which might be of the <i>utmost</i> importance to Albert, and if Albert
      could only have been of service to him in introducing this engine, there
      is literally <i>no telling</i> what might not have come of it. Albert does
      not <i>say</i> that a partnership would have resulted, but I can read it
      in his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would an oil engine have been&mdash;under the circumstances&mdash;you
      know what I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>most</i> suitable!&rdquo; responded Mrs Albert with conviction. &ldquo;It is
      really, it seems, a very surprising piece of machinery. After it&rsquo;s once
      bought, the cheapness of running it is simply <i>absurd</i>. It does all
      sorts of things at no expense worth mentioning&mdash;anything you want it
      to do. It appears that if it had been invented at that time, the pyramids
      in Egypt could have been built by it for something like 130 per cent, less
      than their cost is estimated to have been&mdash;or something like that.
      Oh, it is quite extraordinary, I assure you. Albert says he could stand
      and watch it working for hours&mdash;especially if he had an interest in
      the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hadn&rsquo;t heard that there were any new pyramid plans on just now&mdash;although,
      when I think of it, Shaw-Lefevre did have some Westminster Abbey project
      which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs Albert. &ldquo;One of the engine&rsquo;s greatest uses is in
      agriculture. It does <i>everything</i>&mdash;threshes, garners, mows,
      milks&mdash;or no, not that, but almost <i>everything</i>. No
      self-respecting farmer, they say, dreams of being without one&mdash;that
      is, of course, if he knows about it. You can see what it would have meant,
      if one had been thus publicly introduced on the princely farm at
      Sandringham. All England would have rung with demands for the Oboid&mdash;and
      Albert feels sure that the American man would have been grateful&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;then
      perhaps we need never have left Fernbank at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My poor friend shook her head mournfully at the thought
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Hon. Mrs Coon-Alwyn?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire came back into Mrs Albert&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;That woman,&rdquo; she said, with
      bitter calmness, &ldquo;was positively not ashamed to intrude her own mercenary
      and self-seeking designs upon this loyal and purely patriotic association.
      Why, she did it almost openly. She intrigued behind my back with whole
      streetsful of people that one would hardly know on ordinary occasions,
      paid them calls in a carriage got up for the occasion with a bright new
      coat of arms, made friends with them, promised them heaven only knows
      what, and actually secured nineteen votes to my three for the purchase of
      a mouldy old piece of tapestry&mdash;something about Richard III and
      Oliver Cromwell meeting on the battlefield, I think the subject is&mdash;which
      belonged to her husband&rsquo;s family. Of course, my lips are sealed, but I
      have been <i>told</i> that at Christie&rsquo;s it would hardly have fetched
      £100. I say nothing myself, but I can&rsquo;t prevent people drawing certain
      deductions, can I? And when I reflect also that her two most active
      supporters in this nefarious business were Lady Thames-Ditton&mdash;whose
      financial difficulties are notorious&mdash;and the Countess of Wimps&mdash;&mdash;
      whose tradespeople&mdash;well, we won&rsquo;t go into <i>that</i>&mdash;it does
      force one to ask whether the fabric of British society is not being
      undermined at its very top. In this very day&rsquo;s paper I read that the Hon.
      Mrs Coon-Alwyn has hired a yacht, and will spend the summer in Norwegian
      waters&mdash;while we&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and we made out through the half-light the comfortable
      figure of Uncle Dudley. He was mopping his brow, and breathed heavily from
      his long walk as he advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Mrs Albert asked, in a saddened and subdued tone, &ldquo;Did you see the
      place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are five bedrooms on the two upper floors,&rdquo; he made answer, &ldquo;but
      there&rsquo;s no bath-room, and the bus doesn&rsquo;t come within four streets of the
      house.&rdquo;

      <i>Introducing Scenes from a Foreign Country, and also conveying Welcome
      Intelligence, together with some Instruction</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was at a little
      village perched well up on one of the carriage-roads ascending the
      Brocken, a fortnight or so ago, that I received a wire from Uncle Dudley.
      It was kind of him to think of it&mdash;all the more as he had good news
      to tell. &ldquo;Family lighted square on their feet,&rdquo; was what the message said,
      and I was glad to gather from this that the Grundys had weathered their
      misfortunes, and that Mrs Albert was herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought was full of charm. It seemed as if I had never realised before
      how fond I was of these good people. In sober fact; I dare say that I had
      not dwelt much upon their woes during my holiday. But now, with this
      affectionately thoughtful telegram addressing me as their oldest friend,
      the one whom they wished to be the first to share the joy of their rescued
      state, it was easy enough to make myself believe that my whole vacation
      had been darkened with brooding over their unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not occurred to me before, but that was undoubtedly why I had not
      liked the Harz so much this year as usual. Now that I thought of it,
      walking down the birch-lined footpath towards the hamlet and the telegraph
      office, the place seemed to have gone off a good deal. In other seasons,
      before the spectre of cholera flooded its sylvan retreats with an invading
      horde of Hamburgers, the Harzwald had been my favourite resort. I had
      grown to love its fir-clad slopes, its shadowed glens, its atmosphere of
      prehistoric myth and legend, as if I were part and product of them all.
      Its people, too, had come much nearer to my breast than any other Germans
      ever could. I had enjoyed being with them just because they were what the
      local schoolmaster disdainfully declared them to be&mdash;<i>Erdzertrümmerungsprozeszuribekanntevolk</i>&mdash;that
      is to say, people entirely ignorant of the scientific theories about
      geological upheavals and volcanic formations, and so able cheerfully to
      put their trust in the goblins who reared these strange boulders in
      fantastic piles on every hill top, and to hear with good faith the shouts
      of the witches as they bounded over the Hexentanzplatz. Last year it had
      seemed even worth the added discomfort of the swarming Hamburgers to be
      again in this wholesome, sweet-aired primitive place. But this year&mdash;I
      saw now clearly as I looked over Uncle Dudley&rsquo;s message once more&mdash;it
      had not been so pleasant. The hotel boy, Fritzchen, whom I had watched
      year after year with the warmth of a fatherly well-wisher&mdash;smiling
      with satisfaction at his jovial countenance, his bustling and competent
      ways, and his comical attempts at English&mdash;had this season swollen up
      into a burly and consequential lout, with a straw-coloured sprouting on
      his upper-lip, and a military manner. They called him Fritz now, and he
      gave me beer out of the old keg after I had heard the new one tapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening gatherings of the villagers in the hotel, too, were not
      amusing as they once had been. The huge lion-maned and grossly
      over-bearded <i>Kantor</i>, or music-master, who came regularly at
      nightfall to thump on the table with his bludgeon-like walking stick, to
      roar forth impassioned monologues on religion and politics, and to bellow
      ceaselessly at Fritzchen for more beer, had formerly delighted me. This
      time he seemed only a noisy nuisance, and the half-circle of grave old
      retired foresters and middle-aged <i>Jàger</i> officers who sat watching
      him over their pipes, striving vainly now and again to get in a word
      edgewise about the auctions of felled trees in the woods, or the mutinous
      tendencies of the charcoal-burners, presented themselves in the light of
      tiresome prigs. If they had been worth their salt, I felt, they would long
      ago have brained the Kantor with their stoneware mugs. Even as I walked I
      began to be conscious that a three weeks&rsquo; stay in the Harz was a good deal
      of time, and that the remaining third would certainly hang on my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I reached the telegraph station I had my answer to Uncle
      Dudley ready in my mind. He liked the forcible imagery of Australia and
      the Far West; and I would speak to him at this joyful juncture after his
      own heart. It seemed that I could best do this by giving him to understand
      that I was celebrating his news&mdash;that I was, in one of his own
      phrases, &ldquo;painting the town red.&rdquo; It required some ingenuity to work this
      idea out right, but I finally wrote what appeared to answer the purpose:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Brocken
      und Umgebung sind roth gemalen</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and handed it in to the man at
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a young man with close-cropped yellow hair and spectacles, holding
      his chin and neck very stiff in the high collar of his uniform. He glanced
      over my despatch, at first with careless dignity. Then he read it again
      attentively. Then he laid it on the table, and bent his tight-buttoned
      form over it as well as might be in a severe and prolonged scrutiny. At
      last he raised himself, turned a petrifying gaze on through his glasses at
      me, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some one has you deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I tried to explain to him, with the little German that I knew
      scattering itself in all directions in the face of this crisis, &ldquo;it is a
      figure of speech, a joke, a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telegraph man stared coldly at my luckless despatch, and then at me.
      &ldquo;You would wish to state to your friend, perhaps,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;that
      they seem as if they had been coloured with red, owing to the change in
      the leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;It must be that they <i>have</i> been painted, <i>are</i>
      painted, or he will not me understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my good sir,&rdquo; retorted the operator with emphasis, &ldquo;they are <i>not</i>
      painted! From the door gaze you forth! What make you with this nonsense,
      that Brocken and vicinity are red painted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I said wearily, oppressed by the magnitude of the task, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know how to word it myself, but you can fix it for me. Just say that
      I am <i>going</i> to paint them red&mdash;that will do just as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shall not! It is forbidden!&rdquo; exclaimed the official, holding
      himself like a poker, and glaring vehemence through his glasses. &ldquo;It is
      strongly forbidden! When you one brush-mark shall make, quick to the
      prison go you. In Germany have we for natural beauty respect&mdash;also
      laws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly, but of necessity, I abandoned metaphor, and in a humble
      spirit telegraphed in English to Uncle Dudley at his club that I was very
      glad. Even as my pen clung in irresolution on the paper over this word
      &ldquo;glad,&rdquo; the impulse rose in me to add: &ldquo;<i>Tired of Harz. Am returning
      immediately</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the same here is,&rdquo; remarked the operator, moodily studying the
      unknown words, &ldquo;in Brunswick stopped it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I translated it for him, and added, &ldquo;I go from here home, to be where
      officials their own business mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, not unamiably, and replied as he handed me out my change: &ldquo;Yes,
      I know: England. So well their own business there officials mind, that
      Balfour to Argentina easily comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walking up the hillside again, already quite captive to the fascination of
      the morrow&rsquo;s homeward flight, I met at the turn of the path a family party&mdash;father,
      mother, and two girls in the younger teens&mdash;seated along the rocky
      siding, and gazing with a common air of dejection upon a portentous row of
      bags and portmanteaus at their feet. The notion that they were Hamburgers
      died still-born. Nothing more obviously un-German than these wayfarers was
      ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; the man spoke up as I approached, &ldquo;that I am right in
      presuming that you speak English!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed assent, and even as I did so, recognised him. &ldquo;I hope <i>I</i> am
      right,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;in thinking that I have met you before&mdash;at Mr
      Albert Grundy&rsquo;s in London&mdash;you are the American gentleman with the
      Oboid Oil Engine, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by George!&rdquo; he cried, rising and offering his hand with frank
      delight, and introducing me in a single comprehensive wave to his wife and
      daughters. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and I wish I had an Oboid here right
      now&mdash;up in the basement of that stone boarding-house on the knoll
      there&mdash;just for the sake of heating up, and shutting down the valves,
      and blowing the whole damned thing sky-high. That would suit me, sir,
      right down to the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were strangers here, sir,&rdquo; he explained in answer to my question: &ldquo;we&rsquo;d
      seen a good deal of the Dutch at home&mdash;I mean <i>our</i> home&mdash;and
      we thought we&rsquo;d like to take a look at &lsquo;em in the place they come from.
      Well, sir, we&rsquo;ve had our look, and we&rsquo;re satisfied. We don&rsquo;t want any more
      on our plate, thank you. One helping is an elegant sufficiency. Do you
      know the trick they played on us? Why, I took a team of horses yesterday
      from a place they called Ibsenburg or Ilsenburg, or some such name, and
      had it explained to my driver that he was to take us up to the top of the
      Brocken, there, and stop all night, and fetch us back this morning. When
      we got up as far as Shierke, there, it was getting pretty dark, and the
      women-folks were nervous, and so we laid up for the night. There didn&rsquo;t
      seem anything for the driver to do but set around in the kitchen and drink
      beer, and he needed money for that, and so I gave him some loose silver,
      and told him to make himself at home. We got the words out of a dictionary
      for that&mdash;<i>machen sie selbst zu Heim</i> we figured &lsquo;em out to be&mdash;and
      I spoke them at him slowly and distinctly, so that he had no earthly
      excuse for not understanding. But, would you believe it, sir, the
      miserable cuss just up and skipped out, horses, rig and all, while we were
      getting supper! And here we were this morning, landed high and dry. No
      conveyance, nobody to comprehend a word of English, no nothing. We haven&rsquo;t
      seen the top of their darned mountain even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m more concerned about, I tell Wilbur,&rdquo; put in the lady, &ldquo;is
      seeing the bottom of it. If they had only sense enough to make valises and
      bonnet-boxes ball-shaped, we could have rolled &lsquo;em down hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no trouble about all that,&rdquo; I assured them, and we talked for
      a little about the simple enough process of getting their luggage carried
      down to the village, and of finding a vehicle there. I, indeed, agreed to
      make one of their party on quitting the Harz, that very afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now tell me about the Grundys,&rdquo; I urged, when these more pressing
      matters were out of the way. &ldquo;I got a wire to-day saying&mdash;hinting
      that they are in luck&rsquo;s way again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; exclaimed the American, at once surprised and pleased. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      glad to hear it. I can&rsquo;t guess what it might be in. Grundy&rsquo;s got so many
      irons in the fire&mdash;some white hot, some lukewarm, some frosted
      straight through&mdash;you never can tell. The funny thing is&mdash;he
      can&rsquo;t tell himself. Why, sir, those men of yours in the City of London,
      they don&rsquo;t know any more about business than a babe unborn. If they were
      in New York they&rsquo;d have their eyeteeth skinned out of their heads in the
      shake of a lamb&rsquo;s tail. Why, we&rsquo;ve been milking them dry for a dozen years
      back. And yet, you know, somehow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow&mdash;?&rdquo; I echoed, encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, somehow&mdash;that&rsquo;s the odd thing about it&mdash;they don&rsquo;t
      stay milked.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>it down here by
      the fire&mdash;no, in the easy chair,&rdquo; said Ermyntrude, with a note of
      solicitude in her kindly voice. &ldquo;Mamma won&rsquo;t be home for half an hour yet,
      and I want a nice, quiet, serious talk with you. Oh, it&rsquo;s going to be
      extremely serious, and you must begin by playing that you are at least one
      hundred and fifty years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be so difficult,&rdquo; I replied, not without the implication of
      injury. &ldquo;It will only be adding a few decades to the venerableness that I
      seem always to possess in your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Ermie, and looked at me inquiringly for a moment. Then she
      seated herself, and gazed with much steadiness into the fire. I waited for
      the nice, serious talk to begin&mdash;and waited a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear child,&rdquo; I broke in upon the silence at last, &ldquo;I hoped to
      have been the very first to come and tell your mother how deeply glad I
      was to see you all back again in Fernbank. But that wretched rheumatism of
      mine&mdash;<i>at my age</i>, you know&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was watching narrowly for even the faintest sign of deprecation. She did
      not stir an eyelash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she suddenly began, still intently gazing into the fire; &ldquo;papa has
      got his money all back, and more. That is, it isn&rsquo;t the same money, but
      somebody else&rsquo;s&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know whose. Sometimes I feel sorry
      for those other people, whoever they are, who have had to give it up to
      us. Then, other times, I am so glad simply to be in again where it&rsquo;s warm
      that I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The firelight suits your face, Ermie,&rdquo; I said, noting with the pleasure
      appropriate to my position as the oldest friend of the family, how sweetly
      the soft radiance played upward upon the fair young rounded throat and
      chin, and tipped the little nostrils with rosy light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; she went on, as if I had not spoken, &ldquo;some Americans took
      the house furnished in September for three months&mdash;I think, poor
      souls, that they believed it was the London season&mdash;and so we never
      had to break up, and we were able to get back again in time for Uncle
      Dudley to plant all his bulbs. They seem to have been very quiet people.
      Mamma had a kind of notion that they would practise with bucking horses on
      the tennis-lawn, and shoot at bottles and clay pigeons here in the
      drawing-room. The only thing we could find that they did was to paste
      thick paper over the ventilator in the dining-room. And yet a policeman
      told our man that they slept with their bedroom windows open all night.
      Curious, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to have one of these &lsquo;nice, quiet, serious talks&rsquo; with you,
      Ermie,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at this she did not lift her eyes from the grate. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be
      impatient&mdash;it will be serious enough,&rdquo; she warned me. &ldquo;They say, you
      know, that drowning people see, in a single instant of time, whole years
      of events, whole books full of things. Well, I&rsquo;ve been under water for six
      months, and&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve noticed a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is there a submarine observation station at Clacton-on-Sea? Now you
      speak of it, I <i>have</i> heard of queer fish being studied there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None queerer than we, my dear friend, you may be sure. Mamma was right in
      choosing the place. We never once saw a soul we knew. Of course, it is the
      dullest and commonest thing on earth&mdash;but it exactly fitted us during
      that awful period. We were going at first to Cromer, but mamma learned
      that that was the chosen resort of dissolute theatrical people&mdash;it
      seems there has been a poem written in which it is called &lsquo;Poppy land,&rsquo; 
      which mamma saw at once must be a cover for opium-eating and all sorts of
      dissipation. So we went to Clacton instead. But what I was going to say is
      this&mdash;I did a great deal of thinking all through those six months. I
      don&rsquo;t say that I am any wiser than I was, because, for that matter, I am
      very much less sure about things than I was before. But I was simply a
      blank contented fool then. Now it&rsquo;s different to the extent that I&rsquo;ve
      stirred up all sorts of questions and problems buzzing and barking about
      me, and I don&rsquo;t know the answers to them, and I can&rsquo;t get clear of them,
      and they&rsquo;re driving me out of my head&mdash;and there you are. That&rsquo;s what
      I wanted to talk with you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shifted my feet on the fender, and nodded with as sensible an expression
      as I could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I said you must pretend to yourself that you are very old&mdash;quite
      a fatherly person, capable of giving a girl advice&mdash;sympathetic
      advice. In the first place&mdash;of course you know that the engagement
      with that Hon. Knobbeleigh Jones has been off for ages. Don&rsquo;t interrupt
      me! It isn&rsquo;t worth speaking of except for one point. His father, Lord
      Skillyduff, was the principal rogue in the combination which plundered
      papa of his money. Having got the Grundy money they had no use for the
      Grundy girl. Now, he justified his rascality by pleading that he had to
      make provision for <i>his</i> daughters, and everybody said he was a good
      father. Papa goes in again through some other opening, and after a long
      fight brings out a fresh fortune, which he has taken away from somebody
      else&mdash;and I heard him tell mamma that he was doing it for the sake of
      <i>his</i> daughters. People will say <i>he</i> is a good father&mdash;I
      know <i>I</i> do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None better in this world,&rdquo; I assented cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; Ermyntrude went on, &ldquo;that puts daughters in the
      light of a doubtful blessing. Papa&rsquo;s whole worry and struggle was for us&mdash;for
      <i>me</i>. I was the load on his back. I don&rsquo;t like to be a load. While we
      were prosperous, there was only one way for me to get down&mdash;that is
      by marriage. When we became poor, there was another way&mdash;that I
      should earn my own living. But this papa wouldn&rsquo;t listen to. He quite
      swore about it&mdash;vowed he would rather work his fingers to the bone;
      rather do anything, no matter what it was, or what people thought of him
      for doing it, than that a daughter of his should take care of herself. He
      would look upon himself as disgraced, he said. Those lodgings of ours at
      Clacton weren&rsquo;t specially conducive to good temper, I&rsquo;m afraid; for I told
      him that the real disgrace would be to keep me in idleness to sell to some
      other Knobbeleigh Jones, or to palm me off on some better sort of young
      man who would bind himself to work for me all his life, and then find that
      I would have been dear at the price of a fortnight&rsquo;s labour&mdash;and then
      mamma cried.&mdash;and papa, he swore more&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stirred the fire here, and then blushed to rediscover that it was
      asbestos I was knocking about. &ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; I exclaimed, and
      murmured something about having been a stranger to Fernbank so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ermyntrude took no notice. &ldquo;I made a pretence of going up to London on a
      visit,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and I spent five days looking about, making
      inquiries, trying to get some notion of how girls who supported themselves
      made a beginning. I talked a little with such few girls that I knew as
      were in town, and I cared to see&mdash;guardedly, of course. They had no
      idea&mdash;save in the way of the governess or music teacher. I&rsquo;d cut my
      throat before I&rsquo;d be either of those&mdash;forced to dress like ladies on
      the wages of a seamstress, and to smile under the insults of tradesmen&rsquo;s
      wives and their louts of children. An actress I might be, after I had
      starved a long time in learning my business&mdash;but before that mamma
      would have died of shame. Then there are typewriters, and lady journalists
      and telegraph clerks&mdash;I am surly enough sometimes to do that last to
      perfection&mdash;but they all have to have special talents or knowledge.
      As for saleswomen in the shops&mdash;there are a dozen poor genteel
      wretches standing outside ready to claw each other&rsquo;s eyes out for every
      vacancy. I went over Euston Road way at noon, and I watched the work-girls
      come out of the factories and workshops, and they had such sharp, knowing,
      bullying faces that I knew I should be a helpless fool among them. And
      watching them&mdash;and watching the other girls on the street... in the
      Strand and Piccadilly&mdash;I told you I was going to talk seriously, my
      dear friend&mdash;it all came to seem to me like a nightmare. It
      frightened me. These were the girls whose fathers had failed to provide
      for them&mdash;that was absolutely all the difference between them and me.
      I had looked lazily down at marriage as a chance of escaping being bored
      here at Fernbank. They were all looking fiercely up at marriage as the one
      only chance of rescue from weary toil, starvation wages, general poverty
      and misery. In both cases the idea was the same&mdash;to find some man, no
      matter what kind of a man, if only he will take it upon himself to provide
      something different. You see what poor, dependent things we really are!
      Why should it be so? That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all you want to know, is it?&rdquo; I remarked, after a little
      pause. &ldquo;Well, I think&mdash;I think you had better give me notice of the
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried to read what thinkers say about it,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;but they
      only confuse one the more. There is a Dr Wallace whom the papers speak of
      as an authority, and he has been writing a long article this very week&mdash;or
      else it is an interview&mdash;and he says that everything will be all
      right, that all the nice women will marry all the good men, and that the
      other kinds will die off immediately, and everybody will be oh, so happy&mdash;in
      a &lsquo;regenerated society.&rsquo; That is another thing I wanted to ask you about.
      He speaks&mdash;they all speak&mdash;so confidently about this
      &lsquo;regenerated society.&rsquo; Do you happen to know when it is to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The date has not been fixed, I believe,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early winter twilight had darkened the room, and the light from the
      grate glowed ruddily upon the girl&rsquo;s face as she bent forward, her chin
      upon her clasped hands, looking into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another date which remains undetermined,&rdquo;&rsquo; I added, faltering
      not a little at heart, but keeping my tongue under fair control. &ldquo;I should
      like to speak to you about it, if I may take off my lamb&rsquo;s-wool wig and
      Santa Claus beard, and appear before you once more as a contemporary
      citizen. It is this, Ermie. I am not so very old, after all. There is only
      a shade over a dozen years between us&mdash;say a baker&rsquo;s dozen. My habits&mdash;my
      personal qualities, tolerable and otherwise, are more or less known to
      you. I am prosperous enough, so far as this world&rsquo;s goods go. But I am
      tired of living&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped short, and stared in turn blankly at the mock coals. A freezing
      thought had just thrust itself into the marrow of my brain. She would
      think that I was saying all this because her father had regained and
      augmented his fortune. I strove in a numb, puzzled way to retrace what I
      had just uttered&mdash;to see if the words offered any chance of getting
      away upon other ground&mdash;and could not remember at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired of living,&rdquo; I heard Ermyntrude echo. I saw her nod her head
      comprehendingly in the firelight. She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, except upon conditions,&rdquo; I burst forth. &ldquo;I weary of living alone.
      There hasn&rsquo;t been a time for years when I didn&rsquo;t long to tell you this&mdash;and
      most of all at Clacton, if I had known you were at Clacton. You have
      admitted yourself that <i>nobody</i> knew you were there.&rdquo; The words came
      more easily now. &ldquo;But always before I shrank from speaking. There was
      something about you too childlike, too innocent, too&mdash;too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too silly,&rdquo; suggested Ermie, with an affable effect of helping me out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she unlocked her fingers, and, still looking into the fire, stretched
      out a hand backward to me. &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; she murmured, after a little,
      &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t an answer to my question, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is to mine!&rdquo; I made glad response, &ldquo;and in my question all the
      others are enwrapped&mdash;always have been, always will be. And, oh,
      darling one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is mamma in the hall,&rdquo; said Ermyntrude.

    <h2>
      <i>Describing Impressions of a Momentous Interview, loosely gathered by
      One who, although present, was not quite In it</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>rs Albert has
      smiled upon my suit to be her son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile did not, however, gush forth spontaneously at the outset. When
      the opportunity for imparting our great news came, we three were in the
      drawing-room, and Mrs Albert, who had just entered, had been allowed to
      discover me holding Ermyntrude&rsquo;s passive hand in mine. She cast a swift
      little glance over us both, and seemed not to like what she saw. I was
      conscious of the impression on the instant that Ermyntrude did not
      particularly like it either. An effect of profound isolation, absurd
      enough, but depressingly real, suddenly encompassed me. I began talking
      something&mdash;the words coming out and scattering quite on their own
      incoherent account&mdash;and the gist of what they made me say sounded in
      my ears as if it were a determined enemy who was saying it Why should I be
      speaking of my age, and the fact that I had held Ermie on my knee as a
      child, and even of my rheumatism? And did I actually allude to them? or
      only hear the clamorous echoes of conscience in my guilty soul, the while
      my tongue was uttering other matters? I don&rsquo;t know, and the fear that
      Ermie would admit that she really hadn&rsquo;t been paying attention has
      restrained me from asking her since.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs Albert was paying attention. She held me with a cool and
      unblinking eye during my clumsy monologue, and she continued this steady
      gaze for a time after I had finished. She stirred the small and shapely
      headgear of black velvet and bird&rsquo;s-wing which she had worn in from the
      street, just by the fraction of a forward inch, to show that she
      understood what I had been saying&mdash;and also very much which I had
      left unsaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm&mdash;m!&rdquo; the good lady remarked, at length. &ldquo;I see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mamma, having seen,&rdquo; Ermyntrude turned languidly in her chair to
      observe, lifting the hand which still rested within mine into full and
      patent view, and then withdrawing it abruptly&mdash;&ldquo;having seen, and been
      seen, there&rsquo;s really nothing more to do, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very young,&rdquo; said the mother, in a tentative musing manner which
      suggested the thought that I, on the other hand, was very much the other
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ermyntrude sniffed audibly, and rose to her feet. &ldquo;I am three-and-twenty,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;and that is enough, thank you.&rdquo; There was something in it all
      which I did not understand. The sensation of being out of place, as in the
      trying-on room of a dressmaker&rsquo;s, oppressed me. The sex were effecting
      sundry manouvres and countermarchings peculiar to themselves&mdash;so much
      I could see by the way in which the two were talking with their eyes&mdash;hut
      what it was all about was beyond me. The mother finally inclined her head
      to one side, and pursed together her lips. Ermyntrude drew herself to her
      full stature, threw up her chin for a moment like one of Albert Moore&rsquo;s
      superb full-throated goddesses, and then relaxed with that half-cheerful
      sigh which we express in types with &ldquo;heigho!&rdquo; It was at once apparent to
      me that the situation had lightened&mdash;but how or why I cannot profess
      to guess. Uncle Dudley, to whom I subsequently narrated what I had
      observed, abounded in theories, but upon reflection they do not impress,
      much less convince, me. Here is in substance one of the several
      hypothetical conversations which he sketched out as having passed in that
      moment of pre-occupied and surcharged silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother [<i>lowering brows</i>]. You may be sure that at the very best it
      will be Bayswater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daughter [<i>with quiver of nostrils</i>]. Better that than hanging on for
      a Belgravia which never comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother [<i>disclosing the tips of two teeth</i>]. It is a chance of a
      title going for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daughter [<i>curling lip</i>]. What chance is ever likely <i>here?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother [<i>lifting brows</i>]. He&rsquo;s as old as Methusaleh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daughter [<i>flashing eyes</i>]. That&rsquo;s my business!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother [<i>little trembling of the eyelashes</i>]. You will never know how
      I have striven and struggled for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Daughter [<i>smoothing features</i>]. Merely the innate maternal instinct,
      my dear, common to all mammalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother [<i>beginning to tip head sidewise</i>]. It is true that Tristram
      is docile, sheep-like, simple&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daughter [<i>lifting her chin</i>]. And old enough to be enchained at my
      feet all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother [<i>head much to one side</i>]. And he has always been extremely
      cordial with <i>me</i>&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daughter [<i>chin high in air</i>]. And not another girl in my set has had
      a proposal for <i>years</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother [<i>brightening eye</i>]. We shall be in time to buy everything at
      the January sales!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Mother <i>smiles;</i> Daughter <i>sighs relief. The imaginations of both
      wander pleasantly off to visions of sublimated Christmas shopping, in
      connection with the trousseau and betrothal gifts. General joy.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, this is Uncle Dudley&rsquo;s idea, not mine. My own fancy
      prefers to conjure up a tenderer dialogue, in which the mother, all fond
      solicitude, bids the maiden search well her heart, and answer only its
      true appeal, and the sweet daughter, timid, fluttering, half-frightened
      and wholly glad, flashes hack from the depths of her soul the rapt
      assurance of her fate. But Dudley was certainly right about the ending, as
      the first words Mrs Albert uttered go to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to remind me, then, about presents for the Gregory
      children,&rdquo; she said all at once, in a swift sidelong whisper at
      Ermyntrude. Then she turned, and as I gazed wistfully upon her face, it
      melted sedately, gracefully, a little at a time, into the smile I sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Tristram,&rdquo; she began, and her voice took on a coo of genuine
      kindliness and warmth as she went on, &ldquo;of course Albert and I have had
      other views&mdash;and the dear girl is perfectly qualified to adorn the
      most exalted and exclusive circles&mdash;if I do say it myself&mdash;but&mdash;but
      her happiness is our one desire, and if she feels that it is getting&mdash;I
      <i>would</i> say, if you and she are quite clear in your own minds&mdash;and
      we both have the greatest confidence in your practical common-sense, and
      your <i>honour</i>&mdash;and we have all learned to be fond of you&mdash;and&mdash;and
      I am really very glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of all things in the world, dear lady, I hoped for this,&rdquo; I had
      begun to say, with fervour. I stopped, upon the discovery that Mrs Albert
      was not listening, but had turned and was conferring with her daughter in
      half-audible asides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, no!&rdquo; the mother said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d know in a minute that it had been a
      present to us. That old Mrs Gregory is a perfect <i>lynx</i> for detecting
      such things. I suppose their boys are too big for tricycles, else your
      father knows a dealer who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My own Ermie looked thoughtful. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t seem queer, you think, our
      bursting in upon them with Christmas presents like this&mdash;without
      provocation?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, queer or not queer,&rdquo; said Mrs Albert, &ldquo;it is imperative.
      You know how much depends upon it&mdash;there are plenty of others who
      would be equally useful in various ways, but not like the <i>Gregorys</i>&mdash;and
      if there were there&rsquo;s no time now. If this could have happened, now, a
      fortnight ago, or even last week&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Ermyntrude. &ldquo;It only happened to-day.&rdquo; She
      turned to me, with a little laugh in her eyes. &ldquo;Mamma complains that we
      delayed so long. We have interfered with the Christmas arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had only known! But&mdash;I claim to be treated as one of the
      family, you know&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t quite grasp what you were saying about
      the Gregorys. I gather that our&mdash;our betrothal involves Christmas
      presents for them, but I confess I don&rsquo;t know why. Or oughtn&rsquo;t I to have
      asked, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer Ermyntrude looked saucily into my face, twisted her dear nose
      into a pretty little mocking grimace, and ran out of the room. Mrs Albert
      vouchsafed no explanation, but talked of other matters&mdash;and there
      were enough to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, indeed, till late in the evening, when Uncle Dudley and I were
      upon our last cigar, that I happened to recall the mystifying incident of
      the Gregorys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s simplicity itself,&rdquo; said Uncle Dudley. &ldquo;The Gregorys own one of
      the tidiest country seats in Nottinghamshire&mdash;lovely old house,
      sylvan arbours, high wall, fascinating rural roads&mdash;in the very heart
      of county society, too&mdash;O, a most romantic and eligible place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it? What has that to do with Ermyntrude and me and Santa
      Claus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will read the <i>Morning Post</i> the day after your wedding, my
      dear, dull friend, you will learn that Colonel Gregory has placed at the
      disposal of a certain bridal couple for their honeymoon his ideal country
      residence. The paper will not state why, but I will tell you in
      confidence. It will be because the bride&rsquo;s mother is a resourceful and
      observant woman, who knows how to plant at Christmas that she may gather
      at Easter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to have you always so beastly cynical, Dudley,&rdquo; I was emboldened
      to exclaim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dudley regarded me attentively for an instant. He took a thoughtful
      sip at his drink, and then began smiling at his glass. When he turned to
      me again, the smile had grown into a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are belated, my boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ought to have married into the
      Grundys years ago. You were just born to be one of the family.&rdquo;

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
